Abstract: This paper undertakes a qualitative analysis of the relationship between EU cartel enforcement in the chemical industry in the period 1997-2010 and compliance measures announced in the Annual Reports of the undertakings involved. It goes on to focus on Akzo Nobel NV’s unique use of an internal amnesty programme, and the level of compliance in the industry following this period of enforcement. Its findings are consistent with cartel enforcement prompting significant investment in compliance measures, with some evidence of those measures resulting in the earlier reporting of cartels in return for leniency and in enforcement action against only one hard core cartel in the decade that followed.

Abstract: How does restricting a firm’s ability to raise prices in the future affect the introductory price of new products? This paper considers this question for new molecules launched in the Indian pharmaceutical market. The empirical results from the Indian market show higher launch prices for originators of chronic drugs that were introduced after the regulatory announcement. However, there appears no significant effect on competitor prices. I show that these findings align with a theoretical framework where originators of repeat purchase products increase introductory prices. While the originator secures a higher second period price, the competitor offers significant price cuts to capture new consumers. Overall, these results suggest that regulation delays welfare gains from new drugs, as initially more consumers are left out. The significance of this finding depends on the importance of these new introductions.

Abstract: This paper contributes to the empirical literature on the distributional impact of competition. Using a novel combination of the national survey of household expenditure and the business structure database for the UK, it establishes two descriptive facts. First, the poor are relatively more dependent than the rich on their product purchases and services supplied by more concentrated markets. Second, it sends a significant negative correlation across products and services between the income elasticity of demand and the concentration of the industries supplying those products. At this stage, we draw no inferences from these results. However, this analysis points to some interesting research questions and policy issues concerning the nature of competition in those industries which supply the necessities in consumption.

Abstract: The objectives of this paper are partly to add to the worldwide literature on contemporary levels of concentration – but in our case for a small island economy, and partly to provide a reference study which yields a concise and accessible source for anyone interested in gaining a quick picture of the state of concentration and diversification of the leading firms in Mauritius.  In the main, we have confined ourselves to fact-finding at this stage, and the novelty of the work lies in the descriptive statistical framework within which it is presented. Nevertheless, it is inevitably policy relevant. In our opinion it suggests the need for continuing vigilance of concentration in individual markets, but also more research in the potential competition implications of the fact that the very largest firms have leading, possibly dominant, market shares in more than one industry – is such diversification a cause for competition concern?

Abstract: This work addresses the widespread concern that the forces of competition are weakening worldwide. Much of the evidence for this comes from traditional concentration indices which are notoriously flawed: conceptually they derive from static theory and cannot discriminate between efficiency and market power; empirically, they employ over-aggregate market definitions and ignore international competition. This paper is the first in a programme of research with the objective of resolving some of these problems. The first part of the paper provides a succinct picture of the facts on the HHI index for over 300 UK industries at the 4-digit-level; given data constraints, these refer to producer concentration, ignoring imports and exports. We find that, on average, concentration rose steadily 1998-2011 and remained high thereafter, 2011-2018. About 30% of industries, defined at the 4-digit level, can be classified as “concentrated” or “highly concentrated” using traditional competition authority definitions. In the second part, we provide some indications of how this picture will likely change if we could recompute concentration indices at the more appropriate Anti-Trust Market level and incorporating information on trade competition and exports. High concentration is likely to be even more prevalent at the ATM level, but results might look very different for the sub-set of trade-intensive industries, if we could incorporate trade data into the concentration measures. In the third part, we turn to the major conceptual problem: how to measure competition avoiding the identification problems associated with concentration indices and incorporating a richer dynamic vision of competition as a process. Using an admittedly primitive measure (based on the persistence of leadership rankings within an industry), our early results suggest an increasing tendency for the largest firms to retain their leadership positions over this period. This points to reduced churn in market shares and weakening competition, especially as leadership persistence is found to be more pronounced in more concentrated industries.

Title: Do nudges increase consumer search and switching? Evidence from financial markets

Abstract: As nudge interventions have become more popular, academic research is developing that aims to assess to what extent and under what circumstances these interventions are effective. My paper contributes to this stream of research in a specific context: collating and synthesising evidence on the effectiveness of nudge interventions that aim to increase consumer search and switching in retail financial markets. Following a systematic search strategy, I identified 33 papers containing relevant research, including qualitative studies, online laboratory experiments, field experiments and ex post data analyses, covering a wide range of retail financial products and a number of different types of nudges. The review of these papers results in two main contributions. First, it demonstrates that different study designs serve different purposes in evidence accumulation. In particular, qualitative studies and online lab experiments should not be used to ascertain the magnitude of the intervention’s impact. Second, based on over 400 estimates from the quantitative analyses in these papers, it establishes that the currently available evidence shows that nudges increase consumer search and switching in retail financial markets by 2-3 percentage points on average. The most effective interventions appear to be the ones that make the consumer’s life easier by taking some of the administrative burden over, and the ones that make a relatively major change in the structure of the decision-making environment. Disclosures, reminders, simplifications and informational nudges tend to have a smaller impact. In other words, nudges that change the choice architecture more profoundly have a higher impact on search and switching than nudges that only provide, simplify or highlight information. Overall, while nudge interventions may be efficient on a cost-benefit basis and can lead to large increase in relative terms (e.g. doubling switching rates from 1% to 2%), regulators cannot expect them to alter consumer behaviour to the extent that it would lead to a significant change in the competitive landscape.

Title: Brand bidding restraints revisited – What is the appropriate economic and legal framework for the antitrust analysis of vertical online search advertising restraints?
Author-Name: Elias Deutscher

Abstract: This paper explores the law and economics of brand bidding restraints. By means of this novel type of restraints, brand owners restrict how their licensed retailers use their brand names and trademarks as keywords in paid search advertising. The paper tests and critically reflects on the restrictive approach European competition watchdogs have recently adopted towards brand bidding restraints. It contends that this harsh antitrust treatment of brand bidding restraints is not sufficiently grounded in the economic analysis of vertical restraints. In proposing a comprehensive framework for the legal and economic analysis of brand bidding restraints, the paper makes three principal contributions. First, it asserts that brand bidding restraints can have a number of procompetitive effects by internalising advertising-related externalities, addressing free-riding on display and traditional advertising and facilitating fixed cost recovery through price discrimination. Second, the paper considers different ways through which brand bidding restraints may harm competition and consumer welfare when they disproportionately affect infra-marginal consumers, prevent meaningful intra- and inter-brand comparisons or result in price discrimination on the basis of search costs rather than brand preferences. Moreover, brand bidding restraints are of particular concern when adopted in the context of dual distribution systems where vertically integrated brand owners have an incentive to raise their retailers’ costs to prevent them from cannibalising their own sales channel. Third, the paper explores various legal filters to disentangle and balance the anti- and procompetitive effects of brand bidding restraints. In this respect, the paper makes a number of policy recommendations for the future antitrust analysis of brand bidding restraints. These proposals could also inform the ongoing revision of the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation and Vertical Guidelines in the EU and in the UK.

Abstract: One of the central tenets of industrial organisation is that increasing/decreasing market concentration is likely to lead to increased/reduced markups. But does this affect every consumer to the same extent? Previous literature agrees that there can be significant price dispersion even in the case of homogeneous goods, which is at least partially due to the heterogeneity in how much consumers engage with the market. We link this heterogeneity to the impact of changing market concentration on markups. For this purpose, we employ a combination of 18 years of station-level motor fuel price data from Western Australia and a rich set of information on local market concentration. We summon a non-parametric causal forest approach to explore the heterogeneity in the effect of market exit/entry. The paper offers evidence of the distributional effect of changing market concentration. Areas with lower income experience a larger increase in petrol stations’ price margin as a result of market exit. On the other hand, entry does not benefit the same low-income areas with a larger reduction in the margin than in high-income areas. We argue that these findings are due to differences in how much consumers in different demographic groups engage with the market. Our findings give support to the argument that antitrust could help address inequality while staying true to its mission of promoting competition, provided that priorities are given to not only fixing supply-side problems but also to exploring demand-side remedies.

Title: CK Telecoms and the New Frame of Reference for the Analysis of Unilateral Effects in EU Merger Control

Abstract: In the recent CK Telecoms (Case T-399/16) judgment, the General Court annulled the European Commission’s decision to block the 4-to-3 telecom merger Hutchison3G UK/Telefónica UK. This watershed case is set to curtail the Commission’s ability to challenge future mergers in concentrated markets and proposes a fundamental reshape of the analysis of unilateral effects in the absence of dominance. This article shows that CK Telecoms advances six propositions that form the foundations of a new frame of reference for the analysis of unilateral effects under the EU Merger Regulation. This new framework has been welcomed by commentators as a long-overdue recognition that ‘the law’ trumps the Commission’s administrative discretion and as a vindication of the ‘more economic approach’. Based on a thorough review of 15 years of merger enforcement in the mobile telecommunication sector, this article challenges this account by debunking both the ‘rule of law’ and the ‘more economic approach’ arguments in support of the new framework. It instead demonstrates that each of the six principles advanced by CK Telecoms neither constitutes a reaffirmation of the ‘law’, nor aligns EU merger enforcement with the economic analysis of unilateral effects. In critically reflecting on the new framework laid down in CK Telecoms, this article formulates a number of policy proposals as building blocks for an alternative frame of reference that would preserve the effectiveness of EU merger enforcement in unilateral effects cases while enhancing its legal certainty.

Abstract: This paper fills an important gap in the antitrust compliance literature by exploring the perspective of the price fixer in breaches of competition law. It provides a critical analysis of statements made by price fixers, their competition lawyers and in-house counsel involved in cartel cases. The study draws on a combination of publicly available statements and anonymised accounts collected over 15 years of engaging with each of these three groups. It concludes that those responsible for cartels are motivated by varying factors and do not necessarily understand or accept that cartel behaviour is wrongful. Also, disciplining those individuals is complicated by the incentives created through leniency and settlement programmes. These findings highlight the importance of continued investment in compliance and the broader need for education in competition law to make it less likely that infringements will occur in the first place.

Abstract: Antitrust law enforcement is sometimes criticized for taking too long to obtain results. On the one hand, slowness has potentially harmful consequences for market competition, consumers and business. On the other hand, fast outcomes are perhaps more likely to contain errors in fact and assessment and less likely to form good precedent. To provide a detailed examination of length of process and potential market consequences, the U.S. v Microsoft antitrust case is examined. The case took more than six years between the government receiving a complaint and the end of the last court proceeding. During the investigations and court proceedings, Microsoft’s market share of browser usage rose from less than 20% to above 90%. After the conclusion of the case, its market share declined relatively consistently for many years. A structural breakpoint is found near the end of proceedings, consistent with the long-run efficacy of competition law.

Abstract: This paper attempts to reconcile the goals of competition and equality within antitrust, and in doing so, suggests that this task can be seen to correspond to the efforts that John Rawls made to reconcile liberalism and equality within his principles of justice. Applying a Rawlsian analysis to this problem, I propose the adoption of inclusivity as a secondary objective within competition law (not as an additional primary objective, as for example under a public interest test), and suggest that this approach might therefore be labelled Rawlsian Antitrust. In locating this approach amongst the existing established schools of thought, I emphasise both its economic basis, and the clarity of its values, and how the reconciliation between those might be operationalised. I identify the existence of both pro-enforcement and more cautious factions within this approach. However, I suggest that identifying the common ground between them might form the basis for enabling competition policy to contribute to the fight for greater inclusivity, arguably the great challenge of our time, which was first stirred, and then made urgent by successive crisis that have shaken our world, and which now threaten to burn down the technocratic antitrust chateau.

Abstract: There is growing public concern about the ‘unfairness’ of many pricing practices that have become common in consumer, particularly digital, markets.  Industrial and behavioural economists have developed theories that explain the conditions under which these practices are profitable for firms, and their implications for consumer welfare.  We identify a mismatch between the welfare economic principles used in this theoretical work and the normative perspective in which these practices are viewed as unfair.  We develop a concept of ‘transactional fairness’, grounded in the normative approach of Sugden’s Community of Advantage, that is reflective of public concerns.  Transactional fairness is complementary to established criteria of economic efficiency and distributional equity, but is based entirely on the relationship between individual buyer and seller.  It establishes clear principles with realistic information requirements that are appropriate for compliance by firms.  Regulation based on this approach can help to restore public faith in markets.

Abstract: The measurement of fuel poverty is critical for judgements about the significance of the problem and the design of policies to address it. Reducing fuel poverty has been a government objective in the UK for many years, and is generally seen through the lens of the government’s official fuel poverty statistics . We compare the households identified as fuel poor according to three metrics: (i) the 10% indicator; (ii) the Low Income High Consumption indicator; and (iii) whether households self-report an inability to afford to keep their home warm, using data from the British Household Panel Survey. We find substantial differences in the households identified according to each of these indicators; this highlights a lack of clarity about which households might be considered truly fuel poor. In particular, a surprisingly low proportion of those identified by the 10% and LIHC indicators report an inability to afford to keep their home warm. While this could raise concerns that current fuel poverty policies in the UK are misdirected, instead we emphasise the difficulties of drawing policy conclusions from the differences between the indicators, unless it can be combined with information on households’ heating preferences and the in-home temperatures achieved.

Abstract: The CMA received a large number of complaints about price hikes during Covid-19. In this paper, we first review the economic framework of price gouging and identify the situations when intervention by competition authorities is justified. We then analyse the CMA’s consumer complaints data. We find that most complaints related to essential products sold by small local retailers, including many that operate in some of the most deprived areas of the UK, and their price hikes were particularly likely to harm vulnerable consumers. We also explain the CMA’s antitrust investigations into the pricing of hand sanitisers by retailers. This product, essential for reducing Covid-19 transmission, saw substantial and sustained price increases around March to June 2020. We conclude by discussing the merits of, and challenges for, competition authorities in responding to price gouging concerns and in playing a market observatory role more generally.

Abstract: The period since 1998 has seen major changes in competition law, including: public interest was replace by promotion of competition as the primary duty; anticompetitive agreements and abuse of a dominant position were prohibited, with significant penalties for breach; and the Minister withdrew from case decisions, making the institutions determinative. There were also major organisational changes, including merger of the OFT and CC to form the CMA, and establishment of the CAT as a specialist appeals body. I consider the evolution of these institutions from the perspective of how they frame and influence the quality of first instance determinations. Institutions are hostages to their history, and I trace some of the problems faced by the CMA to its institutional roots. New challenges beyond its control are also identified. Reform is needed. Some of the CMA’s suggestions for legislation are misguided, particularly in replacing its competition duty with ‘the consumer interest’, and reducing the standard of review by the CAT without reform of the CMA. Alternative proposals are considered, including a potential change to a prosecutorial system. I argue that genuinely independent decision-making within the CMA should be preferred and would permit a more limited standard of review.

Abstract: Apple iOS is a closed platform; Google Android is open. In this paper, we combine data on iOS and Android tablet sales with dat a on the top 1000 mobile applications from both platforms for five European countries and estimate a structural demand model. We find that the quality of applications affects tablet demand. We then run two counterfactuals. In line with our theory, the exclusion of low-quality applications is beneficial to tablet producers in both platforms but is more pronounced for Apple. Tablet producers in the plat form with lower quality applications gain most from cross-platform app interoperability.

Abstract: There is growing public concern about the ‘unfairness’ of many pricing practices that have become common in consumer, particularly digital, markets (e.g. auto-renewal at a high price, expensive default add-ons). Industrial and behavioural economists have developed theories that explain the conditions under which these practices are profitable for firms, and their implications for consumer welfare. We argue that there is a mismatch between the welfare economic principles on which this theoretical work is grounded and the normative perspective in which the pricing strategies in question are viewed as unfair. As a result, when regulators look to economics for guidance about fair pricing, they struggle to reconcile two fundamentally different normative approaches. We develop a concept of ‘transactional fairness’, grounded in the normative approach of Sugden’s ‘Community of Advantage’, that is reflective of public concerns. Transactional fairness requires satisfaction of ‘no deception’, ‘no hindrance’ and ‘public explanation’ criteria. It is complementary to established welfare criteria of economic efficiency and distributional equity, but is based entirely on the relationship between individual buyer and seller. Transactional fairness establishes clear principles with realistic information requirements that are appropriate for compliance by firms. The approach potentially helps restore public faith in markets without either deterring the emergence of (non-deceptive and non-hindering) business models, or requiring frequent ad hoc fire-fighting interventions by regulators.

Title: Market Investigations for Digital Platforms: Panacea or Complement?

Abstract: There is a growing international consensus that standard competition law is inadequate for addressing the panoply of competition problems arising in digital platform markets. Alongside a proposal for ex ante regulation in this arena, the European Commission is considering the introduction of a ‘New Competition Tool’ which is broadly modelled on the UK Market Investigation instrument. This paper abstracts from the specifics of the EU situation and considers the pros and cons of market investigations in the context of the UK regime. It concludes that the tool is a valuable addition to the standard competition law toolkit, and that this is likely to be true also at EU level, both for digital platforms and more widely. However, because the tool is potentially so powerful and flexible, it merits strong procedural checks and balances, to guard against confirmation bias or politicisation. The tool also has important limitations and thus should not be viewed as a full solution to the issues raised by digital platforms, but rather as a valuable complementary tool alongside new ex ante regulation. Interoperability is discussed as one example where the tools could valuably be used alongside each other

Abstract: The measurement of fuel poverty is critical for judgements about the significance of the problem and the design of policies to address it. Reducing fuel poverty has been a government objective in the UK for many years, and is generally seen through the lens of the government’s official fuel poverty statistics . We compare the households identified as fuel poor according to three metrics: (i) the 10% indicator; (ii) the Low Income High Consumption indicator; and (iii) whether households self-report an inability to afford to keep their home warm, using data from the British Household Panel Survey. We find substantial differences in the households identified according to each of these indicators; this highlights a lack of clarity about which households might be considered truly fuel poor. In particular, a surprisingly low proportion of those identified by the 10% and LIHC indicators report an inability to afford to keep their home warm. While this could raise concerns that current fuel poverty policies in the UK are misdirected, instead we emphasise the difficulties of drawing policy conclusions from the differences between the indicators, unless it can be combined with information on households’ heating preferences and the in-home temperatures achieved.

Abstract: The year 2019 was a turning point in the debate around how to address competition issues in digital platform markets. At the start of the year, the focus was on reform of competition law. By July, there had been calls – on both sides of the Atlantic – for pro-competitive ex ante regulation. This paper considers these developments through the lens of three influential expert reports, from the EC, UK and US. While the reports offer similar diagnoses of the underlying economic drivers of competition concerns in digital platform markets, they reach somewhat different policy conclusions. The EC report, which was commissioned first, highlights recommendations for antitrust. While it recognises that a regulatory regime may be needed in the longer run, this option is not considered in any detail. By contrast, the UK and US expert reports argue strongly for ex ante regulation. There are other differences too. While the US and EC experts were inclined to relax or reverse burdens of proof for both mergers and abuse of dominance, albeit in specified circumstances only, the UK experts did not recommend this. This paper compares these reports under the categories of mergers, dominance, data, regulation, and international.

Abstract: Do firms increase product lines to deter entry and, if so, when is such a strategy successful? We use data from the UK pharmaceuticals to examine how incumbents respond to change in the threat of entry. In line with the entry deterrence motive, originators' product launch rate is higher when the risk of entry is moderate, but becomes lower when entry is very likely, and the effect is most pronounced in medium size markets. We further find that in medium size markets, originators can deny entry via proliferation if they fill the product space evenly across patients so that each variant has a significant market share of the originators drugs. This does not work in large markets, but here entry is deterred when originators engage in product hopping, i.e., shift most of the patients to newer variants of the drug that may still be protected by intellectual property.

Abstract: Using lobbying data from OpenSecrets.org, we offer several experiments applying machine learning techniques to predict if a piece of legislation (US bill) has been subjected to lobbying activities or not. We also investigate the influence of the intensity of the lobbying activity on how discernible a lobbied bill is from one that was not subject to lobbying. We compare the performance of a number of different models (logistic regression, random forest, CNN and LSTM) and text embedding representations (BOW, TF-IDF, GloVe, Law2Vec). We report results of above 0.85% ROC AUC scores, and 78% accuracy. Model performance significantly improves (95% ROC AUC, and 88% accuracy) when bills with higher lobbying intensity are looked at. We also propose a method that could be used for unlabelled data. Through this we show that there is a considerably large number of previously unlabelled US bills where our predictions suggest that some lobbying activity took place. We believe our method could potentially contribute to the enforcement of the US Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) by indicating the bills that were likely to have been affected by lobbying but were not led as such.

Abstract: Laws protecting intellectual property rights balance interests of earlier and later rights holders. The tradeoffs are well established for patents. We argue that similar considerations apply to trademarks. Jurisdictions differ in how strongly they protect earlier rights, with EU trademark law protecting the registered use of an earlier right for much longer than US trademark law. Laws in both jurisdictions seek to eventually align registered use of earlier rights with their actual use, creating space on the trademark register for later rights. Data from a recent reform of trademark fees reveal that registered and actual use of EU marks frequently fail to align as intended. We analyse trademark opposition cases at EUIPO to test whether this creates costs for owners of later rights. We find that a subset of firms relies on the protection afforded to earlier rights to permanently expand the breadth of their marks beyond actual use, limiting access to trademarks for later applicants. We discuss policy implications.

Title: The supply side to procurement in a health market: competition and innovation in hip implants

Abstract: Most research on procurement of medical devices focuses on buyer behaviour e.g. in the UK, purchasing strategies by the NHS. This paper is a rare case study of the other side of the market. We investigate competition in the artificial hip implant market in England and Wales, using National Joint Registry data for 2005-18. The analysis is in three parts. We first proceed as would a competition agency, by assessing the nature and structure of the market. We find a highly concentrated duopolistic market structure, in which there has been no significant entry or exit, except a merger between the much smaller 3rd and 4th largest suppliers. Viewed through the eyes of a competition economist, such a structure might be indicative of weak competition. However, concentration is not necessarily synonymous with low competition: it might be that technology dictates that only a small number of firms can survive profitably in the market, but that there is still the cut and thrust of competition leading to forever changing identities of the leading firms. In the second part of the paper, we address these possibilities in two ways, using a novel exploration of market share dynamics and an international comparison. On dynamics, we find an important difference between the two sectors of the market: in traditional cemented prostheses, there is little evidence of any share mobility amongst firms. Indeed, the only discernible change is that Stryker, already the dominant firm, has steadily further increased its market share over time. On the other hand, the uncemented sector has exhibited much more share mobility. Interpreting the uncemented sector as a comparator, this suggests the need for further investigation of the cemented sector. This conclusion is also indirectly reinforced by an international comparison of market structure, from which the most striking feature is the much larger market share of Stryker than in any other European country. In the third part of the paper, we explore the performance of the firms concerned, using innovation as the measure. We find only limited evidence of the emergence of new brands of implants - the smaller suppliers have had little success in introducing new brands and the two main suppliers appear to have concentrated on updating their existing brands. There is also little evidence of competition from generic brands, (in contrast to the picture in many parts of the pharmaceutical sector). Looking to the future, our findings are not necessarily conclusive evidence of a weakly performing, anti-competitive market, but they are sufficient to justify further more micro-survey research to identify the preferences and practices of the main players: surgeons, hospital procurement and the suppliers themselves. The need for such research is heightened by the fact that contemporary policy advice increasingly advocates that cemented prostheses should be preferred, especially for older patients.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of exogenous local conditions which favour high market concentration on supply, price and quality in local markets for care homes for older people in England. We extend the existing literature in: (i) considering supply capacity as a market outcome alongside price and quality; (ii) taking account of the chain structure of care home supply and differences between the nursing home and residential care home sectors; (iii) introducing a new econometric approach based on reduced form relationships that treats market concentration as a jointly-determined outcome of a complex contested market. We find that areas susceptible to a high degree of market concentration tend to have greatly restricted supply of care home places and (to a lesser extent) a higher average public cost, than areas susceptible to low degree of market concentration. There is no significant evidence that conditions favouring high market concentration affect average care home quality.

Abstract: Political control of utilities is problematic. On the one hand, the industries have high political salience, meaning that politicians want a serious say in what they deliver. On the other hand, day-to-day political intervention tends to have a high cost in terms of damage to operating efficiency. The UK solution to this conflict has typically been for government to appoint an agent, with a high degree of independence from ministers, to deliver the government's objectives for the utility in question. The agents have been the boards of the public corporations in the nationalised era and the economic regulators in the privatised era. This paper looks at what lessons can be learned from both eras to answer the question of how might political control be better exercised than in the past, in the event that utilities are renationalised. A core conclusion is the desirability of an independent agency (whether or not called a 'regulator') between the minister and the utility, with a transparent ministerial brief to that agency on how it should interpret its (inevitably high-level) statutory obligations.

Abstract: The key question for this paper is by whom and with what restrictions the price of books should be set. In the past, public cultural policy has in some jurisdictions favoured limiting competition at the retail level by mandating a fixed book price system, where prices are the same everywhere. Digitalisation has enabled some competition authorities to challenge this practice. This has left us with a situation where very different rules apply to the book market in different jurisdictions and where the initial question of who sets prices faced with what restrictions is given a very different answer across EU member states. This paper uses recent antitrust cases to highlight the tension over who should have the price setting power in the market for books.

Abstract: Adapting energy distribution systems to new patterns of energy generation and usage often creates tensions between environmental and equity objectives by challenging traditional distributional arrangements and associated charging methodologies. We discuss the principles of fairness and efficiency which might be applied to designing tariffs for residential consumers with self-generation opportunities, and identify the main examples of charging methodologies used in practice. Based on this experience, we develop a stylised model to simulate the effects of a wide range of tariff designs on households with diverse energy use profiles and ability to self-generate. We observe a clear trade-off between incentives to self-generate and distributional concerns across tariff scenarios and show how a net metering scheme may aggravate the trade-off.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new innovation data source to re-examine how spatial distance affects the diffusion of ideas and innovations in an economy. We exploit the descriptions of products and services contained in U.S. trademark registrations during 1980-2012 to identify terms (tokens) not previously used by firms to describe products and services. From these we select tokens frequently re-used by follower firms. By linking the new tokens to the business addresses of innovator and follower firms, our data encompass all instances in which innovations captured by trademark tokens arise within and diffuse across the United States. We aggregate innovations at the year and ZIP code level and estimate Poisson models of the likelihood and intensity of diffusion between locations. After endogenising the creation of new diffusion links between ZIP codes, our results show that spatial distance no longer affects the creation of diffusion links within the US after 1996. However, contingent on previous diffusion from a sending to a receiving ZIP code, we find persistent, strong and negative effects of greater spatial distance on the intensity (extent) of diffusion for existing transfer links between locations within the US.

Abstract: This paper examines how market structure influences the early introduction and consumer uptake of a digital service that is a convenient alternative to traditional service delivery. Digital provision also has "extended geographic reach" and "lower sunk costs" as compared with bricks-and-mortar service provision. We further examine how these affect market structure. Internet banking provides an important example that also allows us to separate regional integration and national concentration dimensions of market structure. We develop an econometric model of the effects of market structure on the introduction and consumer uptake of internet banking. We estimate using panel data for all EU Member States and find that both concentration and regionalisation bring these forward. Next, we examine how consumer uptake of the digital product then begins to impact on banking market structure. We find a substantial de-concentrating effect in large non-regionalised markets and indirect evidence of integration in previously regionalised markets. This is consistent with internet banking having enhanced competition in both integrated markets and, despite little change in national concentration, also in previously regionalised markets.

Abstract: Consumption of general purpose broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with rising levels of antimicrobial resistance. Additionally, industry reports suggest that lack of profitability associated with narrowly targeted pathogens is a potential reason why firms are not undertaking new antibiotic related R&D. In this paper we use aggregate sales data on antibiotics from the UK to estimate a structural demand model and evaluate market performance of firms by spectral activity. We find that broad-spectrum antibiotics are more profitable than narrow-spectrum drugs, though the profitability has increased over time for both types due to a decline in costs, the costs of narrow stay higher. We simulate counterfactual scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of cost-side interventions to shift demand from broad- to narrow-spectrum drugs. Using the last full year of data, simulations show that if unit costs of broad-spectrum were as high as those of narrow-spectrum antibiotics (say due to a unit tax), demand for broad-spectrum would fall by 28.1%, while that of narrow-spectrum would increase by 43.8%. The total cost of such an intervention would be $962 per thousand individuals or a total of $61.26 million, and is inclusive of change in consumer welfare and additional cost of testing for pathogens. Impact of other more selective taxes on subsets of broad-spectrum drugs is also analyzed.

Abstract: Since the turn of the century, an increasing number of competition regimes have adopted ‘settlement’ or ‘commitment’ procedures in an effort to promote flexible and streamlined antitrust enforcement. Korea is one such regime to have introduced a commitment mechanism in the past decade. Yet, the first 7 years of the MRFTA regime have only given rise to 4 competition-based consent decisions. Considering the successful uptake of commitment procedures in numerous other jurisdictions and their attractiveness to both competition authorities and businesses alike, we might therefore ask why Korea’s own procedure has yet to be actively utilised. This paper conducts a comparative legal study between the commitment regime in Korea and its counterpart regimes in the United States and the European Union. Of particular note is the practical significance of a unique condition within Korea’s commitment procedure which requires an applicant to propose consumer damage relief as a remedy within their submission. The paper reviews the effect that this condition has had on utilisation of the procedure and suggests how it can operate in harmony with other aims of the consent decision mechanism in the future.

Abstract: Finding ways to get consumers engaged in markets is a major current topic of debate. This article examines the important role consumer engagement plays in driving effective competition in markets. It then considers some key categories of intervention which can enhance consumer engagement, with a focus on the various roles that disclosure can play. Recent examples are provided from the UK, where many such engagement measures have been implemented. The article emphasises the importance, when policy-makers are designing such interventions, of understanding how real consumers truly behave. It also highlights the relevance to competitive outcomes of two further concepts: relative salience and relative consumer engagement. Finally, the article draws on both the successes and the failures of past interventions to identify some lessons for policy-makers when stepping into this area.

Abstract: The European Patent System consists of national patent offices (NPOs) and the supranational European Patent Office (EPO). EPO and the NPOs have granted patents in Europe side-by-side since 1980. The resulting patent system is complicated and less coordinated than might be expected. Firms must consider a number of variables when selecting the route of patenting they take within this system: price, rigour of examination, duration of examination, quality of legal redress. To date there is little descriptive evidence on how firms choose between EPO and national offices. This paper provides a rich descriptive analysis of patenting in Europe. We analyze how origin, size and technological focus of companies, affect how they choose among patent offices within the EPS and report differences in examination durations and grant rates across patent offices.

Abstract: The introduction of a price cap for consumers who have not switched to cheaper deals in the British energy market reflects increasing political concern about the higher prices paid by these consumers compared with their more active counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate the variations in prices paid by inactive consumers for electricity in different parts of Britain over the last 45 years. The regions identified as the cheapest and most expensive vary noticeably over the period, while the magnitude of the regional differences are, if anything, lower since the introduction of competition than they were before privatisation. We explore the characteristics of consumers who stated that they had never switched supplier, and who were therefore subject to these regional price differences, using unique data from a consumer survey in 2011. Responses to the question ‘have you ever switched supplier’ identified several characteristics of inactive consumers which were consistent with the findings of previous studies: not being retired, having lower electricity expenditure, not having a gas supply and using certain payment methods are associated with a consumer reporting never having switched. However applying a consistency test (namely observing whether consumers reported being with their region’s incumbent supplier) highlighted a number of issues with relying solely on survey data to identify long-term inactivity.

Abstract: While householders’ ability to navigate the domestic retail energy market has generated considerable debate, little attention has been given to micro and small businesses’ (MSBs) purchasing of energy. This paper provides the first academic assessment of MSBs’ satisfaction with the UK’s retail energy market. Using survey data from the UK energy regulator we find that while intermediaries are central to MSBs switching energy supplier, the quantity of marketing contact received from them is a key source of dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction with marketing contact has direct policy relevance as the Competition and Market Authority’s 2016 Energy Market Investigation recommended that a database of ‘disengaged’ MSBs be established to enable marketing communications from rival suppliers to prompt MSBs to switch. We also query whether the need for more MSB engagement is obvious, given the prevalence of multi-year energy contracts among MSBs, suggesting that the ‘optimal’ switching level of MSBs likely differs from that of householders. Our evidence suggests that there could be benefits from increased regulatory oversight of intermediaries’ behaviour. Furthermore we note that existing data fail to address an issue of importance for regulatory decision making: the overlap between households and MSBs and the potential choice for MSBs between domestic and non-domestic contracts. Overall, the paper exemplifies the types of insights that can be obtained by regulators providing wider access to the surveys they commission. We recommend that UK regulatory agencies share anonymised raw survey data by default to enhance the transparency, and potentially quality, of their decision making.

Abstract: The retail energy market in the UK is highly politicised and since the turn of the millennium successive governments have pursued significant policies designed to ease the affordability of energy for certain groups. One of these policies, namely Winter Fuel Payments, represent both a significant increase in resources targeted at affordability support and a shift in emphasis from those on low incomes towards the elderly. This paper tracks the proportion of household expenditure devoted to energy between 1992 and 2014, implementing a major new correction to energy expenditure for households with prepayment meters, who tend to be low income households. First, the time series is used to argue that the political salience of distributional concerns in the retail energy market should not come as a surprise. Second, we find that while households with a head aged over 80 have elevated energy expenditure shares (similar to households at the bottom of the income distribution), pensioners aged 65-70 have energy expenditure shares comparable to households at the middle of the income distribution. Third, mapping major policy developments against the time series shows the most generous and ambitious affordability support schemes were introduced when energy was nearing its most affordable over a 35-year period, suggesting political considerations influenced both the recipients of support and the timing of interventions.

Abstract: Dominant policy understandings of fuel poverty tend to overlook its lived experience. This results in narrow, overly technical problem framings and solutions that neglect the multiple, inter-related and dynamic factors that shape experiences of fuel poverty in situ. Recent qualitative work that has examined the lived experience of fuel poverty has begun to recognise the importance of emotional and subjective experiences to experiences of energy vulnerability, but these are generally regarded as consequences of the problem and thus are not treated as central to analyses. This paper explores a range of emotional engagements with energy vulnerability. The paper draws on new empirical data taken from 16 semi-structured interviews with social housing tenants as well as 10 interviews and a focus group (n=8) with housing association employees. Three distinct forms of emotion engagement were identified as of critical importance for experiences of energy vulnerability: i) worry, fear and control; ii) relationships of care; iii) embarrassment, trust and gratitude. Crucially, and for the first time, the paper shows that emotions are not merely a consequence of energy vulnerability but can also help to cause it. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of these findings.

Abstract: In this article, we revive an old debate in the law and economics literature: the relative role of public and reputational sanctions in deterring misconduct. We propose an empirical framework, which accounts for public sanctions and a more direct measure of reputational sanctions, harnessing recent developments in opinion mining. We use the intensity and the sentiment of media exposure of misconduct as a measure of reputational effect and thus approximation of the reputational sanction. As a demonstration, we combine an event study approach, sentiment analysis, and econometric techniques on a sample of 339 listed cartel member firms, prosecuted by the European Commission between 1992 and 2015. Our results offer evidence that in the context of cartels, public and reputational sanctions act as substitutes.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model to study the effects of an ad valorem taxation regime differentiated according to product characteristics (quality) within an imperfectly competitive market. Then to test our theoretical prediction we use yearly data from the Irish automobile market during the period 2004-2008, and assess the implications of this type of regime on competition and consumer welfare. By emphasizing the role played by the own- versus the cross-price elasticity, we are able to capture an important dimension in which the strategic interactions among firms play out in response to a tax change. The welfare effects of a taxation system that is tailored to product attributes are not trivial. Using a counterfactual analysis based on a homogenous tax rate, we conclude that a differentiated taxation regime benefits consumers who value quality more, while it penalizes those more sensitive to price increments. Our results confirm the extended Ramsey rule predictions. Furthermore, a symmetric increase in taxation narrows the price gap induced by asymmetries in quality and productivity, if the tax regime is homogenous, and widens it, if the tax regime is differentiated.

Abstract: This case study is a relatively rare ex-post evaluation of how the level of innovation changed
after the 5-to-3 consolidation of the world-wide hard disk drive (HDD) industry. We take a holistic view of innovation, employing four different measures: R&D expenditure and patent activity as indicators of innovative inputs, and the number of new products marketed, and their unit user costs as indicators of innovative output. This allows us to distinguish the magnitude of the merging parties' innovative efforts from the productivity of those efforts. Of the remaining HDD manufacturers, for Seagate we found an increase in all our innovation measures following the mergers, but for Western Digital the evidence is mixed. Methodologically, the paper draws light on some of the challenges of conducting similar case-specific retrospective studies on the impact of mergers on innovation.

Abstract: Have regulators improved their capacity to detect or deter financial misconduct since the global financial crisis? This study addresses this question through an analysis that differentiates between detection and deterrence of financial misconduct over the period 2002-2016. To make this determination a CaptureRecapture, trap response model within a difference-in-differences framework is used to examine regulatory notices and supplementary information issued by UK financial regulators with corresponding Australian data employed as an unbiased control. Examining pre- and post-financial crisis periods, we offer evidence, whilst there was no statistically significant change in detection rates for breaches of financial regulation, there was a significant increase in the rate of deterrence occurred after 2010. We interpret this result as an increase in the efficacy of regulation of financial misconduct in recent years.

Abstract: Retailers act as both customers and competitors for brand manufacturers when selling private label in direct competition with brands. This paper considers whether retailers exploit this double-agent position to practice switch marketing, manipulating elements of the retail marketing mix to encourage shoppers to switch from buying brands to private label. Such manipulation can be blatant in nature, such as comparative advertising, brand delisting trials, copycat packaging, and biased shelf allocation. However, the key interest in this paper concerns whether retailers use a more subtle means through strategic pricing to favour private label over brands. The paper reveals very different price treatments of brands and matching private label goods. However, the identified pricing patterns are more indicative of retailers manipulating prices for the sake of segmenting consumers rather than displacing brands.

Abstract: Water scarcity is a global concern. Even in non-drought environments the political and economic costs of developing water resources may favour water conservation. Using a single high price to constrain demand raises distributional and political challenges. Increasing block tariffs (IBTs) have been proposed as a potential solution, balancing incentives for water conservation with an equitable distribution of costs across households. An alternative approach that may side-step affordability concerns is to use non-price conservation interventions. We survey the literature on IBTs and behavioural interventions (a subset of non-price interventions) to assess their effectiveness, thereby highlighting the operational challenges of implementing effective IBTs. Robust evidence on behavioural interventions is limited, although, social comparisons appear to be effective for conservation. We discuss the implications of the evidence for the UK, a country with a temperate climate. We note that existing interventions have been typically implemented in response to drought situations, so one may question the validity of existing evidence for designing interventions in non-drought situations. We suggest an essential first step before implementing an IBT is research to understand a locality’s water consumers and their water demand. That many UK households have an unmetered water supply presents challenges both for gaining this understanding of demand and producing an evidence base around behavioural interventions.

Abstract: Liberalised retail energy markets present an apparent puzzle: when offered the chance to buy a homogeneous product at a lower price, many consumers appear to leave ‘money on the table’. We observe the decisions made by over 7,000 consumers in a collective switching exercise and find that seemingly suboptimal consumer behaviour may be understood better if a sufficiently rich range of non-monetary ‘switching costs’ are identified. We discuss some policy implications for the expectations of consumer response in designing and regulating markets.

Abstract: This paper searches for evidence that, as a Competition Agency (CA) builds up experience in cartel enforcement, this feeds back into the business community to deter future cartel formation. We present two simple models, focussing respectively on composition and frequency deterrence, which describe how the feedback would work. The ideal outcome is that, over the long-run, the number of cartels detected by a successful CA will follow an inverted U-shaped time path: its propensity to detect increase, but the number of cartels out there to be detected decrease. Empirically, we try to simulate the long-term dimension by using an international panel of CAs. Although comparable data are only available for a relatively short time period (2006-2014) we hope that longer-run effects are captured by including in the panel CAs at very different stages in their life cycles. We find evidence of the predicted inverse U shape, and interpret this as consistent with an increasingly strong feedback from enforcement to deterrence as the CA evolves over the years.

Abstract: An overwhelming stream of research suggests that online reviews impact firms' profits positively. In this study we show conditions where this may not hold true. In a vertical market, we identify strategies that a manufacturer can utilize to affect a retailer's attitude towards publicizing consumer reviews. We model a two-period multi-stage game where vertically integrated and separated firms co-exist and choose prices (of old and new products) and product quality (of new products) along with information strategies. We study the extreme situation where new products have no reviews available yet (i.e., only old products have reviews or the possibility of having reviews). Our main findings are that in a separated distribution channel, the manufacturer always benefits from the availability of online reviews, whereas the retailer only benefits if consumer valuation for a new product is sufficiently low. When competition is not too tough and consumer valuation for the new product is not too high, the manufacturer may opt for discounting the wholesale prices to prompt the retailer to post the online reviews. Furthermore, when consumer uncertainty for the new product is sufficiently low, the optimal strategy for the manufacturer is to limit the release of technical information.

Abstract: We develop a general model of a simple imperfect monitoring setting to analyse how market transparency affects collusion when price wars occur in equilibrium. We show that, despite minimal structure on the competition game and despite the usual ambiguous effect on the critical discount factor, increased consumer side transparency strictly lowers the best collusive profits. In contrast, increased producer-side transparency lowers the critical discount factor and raises the best collusive profits. Placing more structure on the competition game, we analyse these counteracting effects when market transparency affects both sides of the market.

Abstract: Voluntary carbon offset schemes have sprung up in the last decade offering individuals opportunities to neutralize their own carbon footprint. These schemes strongly appeal to the personal responsibility of individuals in reducing the carbon emissions they cause. In this paper we report on a controlled laboratory experiment to better understand the behavioral motivations driving the purchase of carbon offsets, i.e., payments towards the reduction of damages to the environment. We show that the opportunity to offset damages does not affect the total damages created by the individuals when individuals trade in competitive markets. At the same time, we find a stable demand for carbon offsets when the price is sufficiently low. Therefore, introduction of carbon offsets increases efficiency by eliminating some of the damages ex-post. Behavior, however, is very heterogeneous. Individuals with a high (low) personal-responsibility index increase their offset purchases as their own damage (total damages) increases, but do not condition their offsetting behavior on the total damages (own damages) created.

Abstract: Despite the fact that competition law prohibits explicit cartels but not tacit collusion, theories of collusion often do not distinguish between the two. In this paper, we address this issue and ask: under which types of market structures are cartels likely to arise when firms can alternatively collude tacitly? To answer this question, we analyse an infinitely repeated game where firms with (possibly asymmetric) capacity constraints can make secret price cuts. Tacit collusion can involve price wars on the equilibrium path. Explicit collusion involves firms secretly sharing their private information in an illegal cartel to avoid such price wars. However, this runs the risk of sanctions. We find that, in contrast to the conventional wisdom but consistent with the available empirical evidence, cartels are least likely to arise in markets with a few symmetric firms, because tacit collusion is relatively more appealing in such markets. We discuss the implications for anti-cartel enforcement policy.

Title: Three forms of BT Separation: Objectives, solutions and effects

Abstract: Following its latest strategic review of the digital communications sector, Ofcom has proposed that BT’s access services division, Openreach, becomes a subsidiary of BT plc. BT has put forward a counter proposal it terms Enhanced Functional Separation. This paper reviews the two proposals and compares them with the current situation. It finds that the differences between BT’s and Ofcom’s proposals are less substantive that might appear at first sight. The paper also considers the whether the incentives for BT to invest in taking fibre access networks closer to the customer are likely to be any different under the two proposals. Again, the paper is sceptical that the legal separation proposed by Ofcom would result in greater incentives than would occur under Enhanced Functional Separation.

Abstract: This paper provides a pan-EU mapping of energy affordability using energy expenditure shares for the first time. Large variations in energy expenditure shares across the EU are identified, with the shares being significantly higher in New Member States than the EU15. These variations indicate that a pan-EU fuel poverty metric is inappropriate. Secondly, household-level data from the UK, France and the Republic of Ireland are used to simulate the impact of policy interventions on the recorded rate of fuel poverty. These simulations highlight that emphasising high-level fuel poverty metrics may distort policymakers’ decisions towards manipulating the ‘picture’ of fuel poverty rather than maximising welfare improvements; policymakers may assist households lying closest to fuel poverty thresholds rather than those most in need. Robust impact assessments identifying the fuel poverty interventions which deliver the greatest welfare increases for a given cost offer a better means of policy evaluation.

Abstract: Using tools from behavioural economics and psychology to establish non-financial ways to incentivise people to reduce domestic energy usage has become a popular and ever-expanding area of research. This study builds upon the existing literature by providing subjects with energy performance information at group-level in a controlled field experiment setting. The results indicate that the provision of this relative information does stimulate energy-conserving behaviour, and this is most pronounced among those who held pre-trial preferences for sustainable living. Because these participants are more responsive to comparative information, one conjecture is that the attitudes and structure of social groups could be a key driver in determining the extent to which behavioural change is achievable. These results therefore imply that there is a role for issuing relative information on performance, but that the role of group cohesion and affiliation could heavily determine the magnitude of these effects.

Abstract: We use online search data to predict car sales in the German and UK automobile industries. Search data subsume several distinct search motives, which are not separately observable. We develop a model linking search motives to observable search data and sales. The model shows that predictions of sales relying on observable search data as a proxy for pre-purchase search will be biased. We show how to remove the biases and estimate the effect of pre-purchase search on sales. To assist identification of this effect, we use the introduction of scrappage subsidies for cars in 2008/2009 as a quasi-natural experiment. We also show that online search data are (i) highly persistent over time, (ii) potentially subject to permanent shocks, and (iii) correlated across products, but to different extent. We address these challenges to estimation and inference by using recent econometric methods for large N, large T panels.

Abstract: We use ADHD drugs sales data from 2000-2003 and compare estimates of elasticities and merger simulations from three different demand models. Models include logit, random coefficients logit, and conditional AIDS demand model with multistage budgeting. The magnitude of cross-price elasticities is larger in the third model in comparison to the first two, and some of the cross-price elasticities are estimated to be negative. Hypothetical merger simulations show larger price effects for the multistage AIDS model in comparison to the discrete choice models.

Abstract: The price effect of past mergers has been extensively researched over the last two decades. The overwhelming majority of these studies pool post-merger data to estimate the average price effect of a merger. Merger guidelines agree that mergers should be approved if market dynamics, such as entry, eliminate negative welfare effects. However, pooled post-merger data ignore key information about price dynamics and are unable to identify if post-merger prices eventually revert to pre-merger levels or drift away. We provide evidence, from a meta-analysis of previous works, and a set of Monte Carlo experiments, on how serious this problem is. Finally, we show the conditions where pooled data studies make an erroneous conclusion about the merger.

Abstract: In this review of retrospective European merger studies we provide a discussion of the price effect of analysed mergers and examine whether the antitrust agency made the right decisions. We find that remedied mergers, on average, were not followed by a price-increase, suggesting that, in our sample, merger interventions were effective at eliminating problems. High market concentration was more likely to lead to higher post-merger prices, although remedies were able to reduce post-merger price-increases, even in concentrated markets. We look at a number of reasons why prices may increase post-merger and find little evidence of genuine agency errors.

Title: Accommodating Public Interest Considerations in Domestic Merger Control: Empirical Insights

Abstract: In the wake of recent convergence initiatives, many countries now adopt a competition-based approach to merger control assessment. Given the emphasis that is placed on competition criteria in these assessments, the influence of wider ‘public interest’ criteria has become increasingly marginalised. Yet despite this marginalisation, many merger regimes continue to afford scope to public interest criteria – which poses a number of questions regarding the feasibility of further convergence internationally. This paper conducts an empirical study of 75 domestic merger regimes to draw two sets of insights. Firstly, the paper identifies the different means by which states have chosen to accommodate public interest criteria within their domestic merger laws. It finds that most states will: (i) treat the public interest as an ‘exception’ to a competition-based test or frame it within sector-specific policy, and (ii) assign decision-making powers to either a national competition authority or a politician. Secondly, the paper explores the socio-economic factors that may influence how a state choses to accommodate public interest criteria. Statistical analysis suggests that factors traditionally thought of as influential (such as economic development) have only a negligible correlation with the chosen method of accommodation. In contrast, the ‘effectiveness’ of domestic governance within a state appears to demonstrate a significant correlation with how states choose to frame public interest criteria within legislation.

Abstract: This paper looks at the origins and limits of EU health law and policy. The main questions asked are whether EU health law is expanding and how; whether it operates within fixed limits; and whether healthcare is a special case in EU integration. Special attention is paid to the emergence of a specific legal basis in Article 168 TFEU alongside the general internal market provisions of the EU, and its sector-specific subsidiarity provision which suggests healthcare was at least intended to be a special case: a policy largely reserved to the national level. In practice however the EU competence in this field is expanding not only as a matter of negative integration (striking down conflicting national rules to promote the internal market), but also in terms of cooperation between the Member States. Finally the recent impact of general financial curbs on the welfare State (such as are imposed in the context of the European semester) show that in spite of national efforts to retain control over healthcare, such control is in fact steadily eroded. The result is less the emergence of a unified EU policy than a complex system of partial overlapping national and EU competences that may come both come into conflict and complement each other.

Abstract: New drug introductions are a key to growth for pharmaceutical firms. However not all innovations are the same and they may have differential effects that vary by firm size. We use quarterly sales data on UK pharmaceuticals in a dynamic panel model to estimate the impact of product (new drugs) and marketing (additional pack varieties) innovations within a therapeutic class on a firm's business unit growth. We find that product innovations lead to substantial growth in both the short and long run, whereas a new pack variety only produces short-term effects. The strategies are substitutes but the marginal effects are larger for product innovations relative to additional packs, and the effects are larger for smaller business units. Nonetheless, pack introductions offer a viable short-term growth strategy, especially for small and medium sized businesses.

Abstract: There is widespread evidence that some firms use false advertising to overstate the value of their products. Using a model in which a policymaker is able to punish such false claims, we characterize a natural equilibrium in which false advertising actively influences rational buyers. We analyze the effects of policy under different welfare objectives and establish a set of demand and parameter conditions where policy optimally permits a positive level of false advertising. Further analysis considers some wider issues including the implications for product investment and industry selfregulation.

Abstract: Most-favoured-customer (MFC) clauses adopted by online platforms in their relevant contractual relationships guarantee to an online platform that a supplier will treat the platform as favourably as the supplier’s most-favoured-customer concerning price, availability and similar terms of a given transaction. These clauses are a fundamental aspect of the business models of some of the world’s leading companies such as Apple, Amazon, Expedia, etc. The competition law implications of these clauses have been one of the key concerns of over a dozen competition authorities around the world in recent years. The competition authorities involved have adopted different approaches and reached different substantive and procedural outcomes, sometimes in proceedings that concern the application of the same legal rule against the same company. This is best demonstrated by the line of investigations pursued against certain online travel agents in Europe. This article posits that such diverging approaches lead to legal and business uncertainty, as well as to procedurally unfair and substantively incorrect assessments. In an effort to rectify this suboptimal situation, the article provides a comprehensive, principled approach for the assessment of platform MFC clauses under competition law – in particular, under EU competition law.

Abstract: In this paper, a new empirical screen for detecting cartels is developed. It can also be used to date the beginning of known conspiracies, which is often difficult in practice. Structural breaks that are induced by cartels in the data generating process (DGP) of industry prices are detected by testing reduced form price equations for structural instability. The new screen is applied to three European markets for pasta products, and it successfully reports the cartels that were present in the Italian and Spanish markets, but finds no suspicious patterns in the French market, which was not cartelised.

Abstract: The EU Damages Directive came into force in December 2014. One of its objectives is to ensure the effective private enforcement of competition law by facilitating damages claims in the courts of the EU Member States. This paper looks closely at the Directive’s compensation goal and the key arrangements that are to encourage victims to seek redress in the courts. The paper uses a simple framework to demonstrate that the Damages Directive is unlikely to foster compensation because it fails to create incentives for harmed individuals to commence legal action. If more compensation claims are desired, the Member States should devise a framework for private antitrust actions that goes beyond the Directive’s remit by, for example, allowing class actions.

Abstract: We analyze the effect of patent thickets on entry into technology areas by firms in the UK. We present a model that describes incentives to enter technology areas characterized by varying technological opportunity, complexity, and the potential for hold-up due to the presence of patent thickets. We show empirically that our measure of patent thickets is associated with a reduction of first time patenting in a given technology area controlling for the level of technological complexity and opportunity. Technological areas characterized by more technological complexity and opportunity, in contrast, see more entry. Our evidence indicates that patent thickets raise entry costs, which leads to less entry into technologies regardless of a firm’s size.

Abstract: This paper reports the results of four surveys gauging public attitudes to price fixing and cartel enforcement in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the United States. A previous study was carried out in the UK in 2007. The results show a robust understanding that price fixing is harmful and popular support for enforcement and punishment. In particular, there is a strong expectation that businesses should calculate their prices independently of each other. Overall there is surprising uniformity in opinion between the four jurisdictions despite significant differences in culture and levels of enforcement. Support for the imprisonment of cartelists has significantly increased in the UK since 2007, but the results suggest price-fixing is still viewed as being less serious than traditional crime and some other forms of corporate wrongdoing.

Abstract: We compare the wholesale structure and the agency structure characterizing a supply and distribution chain in a bilateral duopoly model with product differentiation at both the supplier level and the retailer level. We first assess welfare implications under the two structures. Relative to the wholesale structure, we find that the agency structure leads to lower retail prices, higher demand and higher consumer surplus. A social planner always enjoys higher differentiation in the market, and her favoured business format shifts from the wholesale structure to the agency structure as goods and services become more differentiated. We then examine firms’ preferences over the alternative schemes. Suppliers prefer the wholesale structure whereas retailers prefer the agency structure as long as the degrees of differentiation at the supplier level are not too low. Ceteris paribus, the social planner prefers when retailers can choose their preferred business format if suppliers and retailers have conflicting preferences.

Abstract: We examine the profitability, entry deterrence and welfare effects of proliferation offered by non-cooperative firms competing in quality and price. In a market of one high quality firm and competitive low quality firms, we find that the established high quality firm will not initiate proliferation but may have an incentive to do so if facing entry threats. The proliferation quality is endogenously determined and the industry profit decreases with such proliferation. Moreover, we show that proliferation increases consumer surplus in the same way as entry does. That is, while proliferation to deter entry is anti-competitive, it is not necessarily welfare-reducing.

Abstract: During patent litigation, pay-for-delay deals involve a payment from a patent holder of a branded drug to a generic drug manufacturer to delay entry and withdraw the patent challenge. In return for staying out of the market, the generic firm receives a payment, and/or an authorized licensed entry at a later date, but before the patent expiration. We examine why such deals are stable when there are multiple potential entrants. We combine the first mover advantage for the first generic with the ability of the branded manufacturer to launch an authorized generic to show when pay-for-delay deals are an equilibrium outcome. We further show that limiting a branded firm's ability to launch an authorized generic prior to entry by a successful challenger will deter such deals. However, removing exclusivity period for the first generic challenger will not.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a specific strategy that developers of mobile applications may use to stimulate demand: the release of updates. We start with a stylised theoretical analysis to describe the developer's decision to release an update. Its predictions are then tested by using an unbalanced panel with the top 1,000 apps in iTunes and Google Play for five European countries. We show that while in iTunes updates increase the rate of growth of downloads, in Google Play their effect is not significant. We argue that the lack of quality control by Google Play can lead to an excess of updating. We also find that the past performance of the app influences the decision to release an update, but only in iTunes. This finding is in line with our theoretical analysis and can again be interpreted on the basis of the different way of governing the release of updates in the two stores.

Abstract: Striking the right balance between protection competition law and intellectual property rights is of utmost importance, especially in the pharmaceutical sector; affordable generic drugs are as important as new innovative drugs. Pay for delay settlements take place at exactly this intersection. They end patent infringement litigation but, at the same time, delay entry of generic drugs by means of a substantial payment from the brand company to the generic. Whereas, the US Supreme Court opted for a rule of reason approach which requires an analysis of the potential anticompetitive effects, the European Commission regarded such settlements as restriction by object, finding an infringement without the need for an effects-based analysis. This approach is criticised and a novel "structured effects-based" approach is proposed allowing the authority to effectively scrutinise such settlements while striking the right balance in order to protect the innovative process and the exercise of intellectual property rights.

Title: Adding a New Dimension to EU Pharmaceutical Antitrust - Pay for Delay Settlements as Part of a Unilateral Strategy such as Product Hopping
Author-Name: Sven Gallasch

Abstract: Pay for delay settlements are currently at the centre of the European Commission’s enforcement activities in the pharmaceutical sector. The focus in these investigations is on the collusive nature of the agreements between a brand company and generic companies and the associated anticompetitive potential. This paper advocates the broadening of the antitrust scrutiny of pay for delay settlements to unilateral conduct. It argues that pay for delay settlements could be used as a "facilitator" for broader unilateral conduct by the brand company such as product hopping. The developed theory of harm is based on the fact that pay for delay settlements in Europe are less likely to foreclose the market for generics than they do in the United States, but they ‘only’ delay generic entry in most cases. This delay could however ‘buy’ the brand company enough time to achieve a broader unilateral strategy. As part of the overall analysis, highlighting a more general issue of European competition law, the paper takes issue with the concept of ‘competition on the merits’ suggesting that there could be merit in considering the concept in the context of the actual facts of the individual case at hand and not in isolation.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the attributes and effects of post-cartel tacit collusion (PCTC) as well as policy measures aimed at its prevention. PCTC occurs irrespective of the absence or presence of an antitrust authority and in different competition regimes. PCTC is determined both by collusive price hysteresis and learning about cartel partners’ characteristics and strategies. As a result, it is strongly related with the preceding cartel success. The estimation of cartel overcharges, an important factor in litigation, is found out to be biased downwards in the presence of PCTC. As a policy note, we show that debarment of managers involved in cartels from the market can prevent PCTC.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of the ‘Regulatory State’ through the lens of utility regulation. The review is multidisciplinary with it bringing together the insights available from the political science, economics, legal and management science literatures. It is clear that while the term ‘Regulatory State’ is essentially missing from the economics literature a vast array of economics papers provide valuable insights for debates about the Regulatory State within political science. In addition to reviewing the existing literature, the paper identifies opportunities for future research. The literature is grouped into five topics: (i) Consumers, (ii) Courts, (iii) Ideas, Experts and Expertise, (iv) Governance and (v) Assessing Regulator Performance. Apart from (iv), we believe all of these areas have been under-researched in relative terms. In particular, a key finding is that compared to the information available on Public Utility Commissioners in US States, very little information has been collated on the background, characteristics and careers of individual utility regulators working within Europe.

Abstract: Evaluations of the consumer harm caused by cartels are typically partial because they do not attempt to quantify the impact of deterrence, or acknowledge that the CA does not root out all anti-competitive cases. This paper proposes a broader framework for evaluation which encompasses these unobserved impacts. Calibration of this framework is challenging because one cannot rely on estimates for cases which have been observed to make deductions about those that have not – an example of the classic sample selection problem which is endemic across much of the empirical Industrial Organisation literature. However, we show how empirical findings, already available in the existing literature, can be plugged into a Monte Carlo experiment to establish bound estimates on the magnitudes of cartel-induced consumer harm. Lower bound (i.e. cautious) estimates suggest that (i) the harm detected by the CA really is only the tip of the iceberg, accounting for only a small fraction (at most one sixth) of total potential harm; (ii) deterrence is at least twice as effective as detection as a means for removing harm; and (iii) undetected harm is at least twice as large as detected harm. Under less cautious, but very plausible, assumptions, all three effects could be much greater than this.

Abstract: This paper seeks to assess the robustness of the assumptions made by much of the theoretical literature on leniency programs, giving a glimpse of the uncertainties and complexities that apply in practice. First, sanctions are hard to estimate and the decision to form a cartel is not generally made by the firm as a rational monolith. Second, empirical evidence from the EU suggests an over-reliance on leniency, with only a weak threat of detection through investigations alone. Most leniency reporting may be occurring where a cartel has already ceased to operate or is very likely to be caught. Finally, the decision to come forward is not one that is taken lightly by the firm; it is fraught with uncertainties and dangers, including the challenges of ensuring cooperation from employees. The paper concludes with three recommendations for the strengthening of leniency policies.

Abstract: This paper considers the nature of competition between national brands and store brands (otherwise known as private label or own label goods). We expound an analytical framework that allows for both price and non-price (quality) competition and use this to see how these different forms of rivalry interact in a setting where a leading retailer offering a store brand acts as both a customer and competitor to a national brand producer. This relationship thus entails both vertical and horizontal competition. We show that generally the retailer will seek to position its store brand as closely as possible to the national brand, by seeking to minimise the quality gap, but price the two goods very differently, with a wide price gap, as a means to segment consumers. Store brand introduction can lead to overall higher prices, so be against consumers’ interest, unless there is intense head-to-head rivalry for value-conscious consumers. Intense rivalry is more likely to happen if the national brand producer can exercise some control over its own product’s retail price (e.g. by being allowed to use maximum resale price maintenance) and has protection against copycat (lookalike) store brands ensuring a degree of differentiation between the competing products. Accordingly, we suggest that there are horizontal competition benefits on top of the usual vertical (alleviating double marginalisation) and intellectual property (to encourage brand investments) reasons to support respectively a more lenient policy stance towards RPM and a tougher stance against parasitic copycatting. The mix of horizontal and vertical aspects has important implications for undertaking market definition analysis in CPG markets, and specifically testing whether store brands and national brands are in the same product market. We highlight the considerable care needed in applying and interpreting the usual price and demand elasticity analysis used in market definition tests because of how segmentation and item-by-item retail pricing can distort demand and sales patterns.

Abstract: Very little is known empirically about deterred cartels. Therefore, although the characteristics of detected cartels are well documented, it is unclear that they are a representative sample. If deterred or undetected cartels differ systematically from the detected, many of our conventional empirical wisdoms could be subject to sample selection bias. Similarly, the impact of cartel policy, based only on prosecuted cases, could be systematically under-estimated. This paper addresses this gap in our knowledge, and explores how far a key characteristic - the overcharge - differs between deterred and undeterred cartels. First we examine an existing well-known database on cartels and find that the distribution of overcharge for legal cartels has significantly greater mass in its tails than the distribution for illegal cartels. Taking legal cartels as a proxy for a world without enforcement policy, this suggests that it is the lowest and highest overcharge cartels which are most likely to be deterred, or undetected, by cartel enforcement policy. Second, we summon a theoretical model of cartel formation to show that, under very reasonable assumptions, it is deterrence that explains the reduced occurrence of low and high overcharge cartels when faced with antitrust enforcement.

Abstract: A number of recent cases have involved a hitherto rarely observed form of Most Favoured Nation clauses in which sellers through an internet retail platform agree not to sell at a lower price elsewhere, including through other retail platforms. We first note that such Retail Price MFN clauses rely on some form of RPM for their existence. We then argue that much of the existing academic literature and case law on RPM effectively combines two elements of RPM, an explicit (and inherent) vertical element and a more implicit horizontal element, the latter being particularly egregious in terms of anticompetitive harm. As retail price MFN clauses essentially mimic this latter, and worst, element of the RPM, we finally argue that such clauses should be treated no less harshly than RPM under competition law.

Abstract: We explore the effects of asymmetries in capacity constraints on collusion where demand is uncertain and where firms must monitor the agreement through their privately observed sales and prices. We show that deviations will be detected perfectly when demand fluctuations are sufficiently small. Otherwise, monitoring is imperfect and punishment phases must occur on the equilibrium path. Collusion is hindered in both cases when the largest firm has more capacity and when the smallest firm has less. We demonstrate that a merger with a collusive symmetric outcome can have a lower average best equilibrium price than a more asymmetric non-collusive outcome.

Abstract: This paper considers whether the use of individual informant rewards or bounties is a viable cartel detection tool. Rewards have the potential to enhance enforcement by revealing infringements that would otherwise go undetected. In order to be effective they should be made available to individuals directly involved in cartels because they may be the only viable source of information. Mere protection from retaliatory measures of employers does not create an adequate incentive to report misbehaviour. The personal costs and risks associated with whistleblowing are so significant that effective rewards may need to amount to a lottery win in order for reporting to be worthwhile. Reward systems pose some dangers to the enforcement system, but these can be managed.

Abstract: Using a large and comprehensive data set containing the average weekly prices of barcode specific products sold in seven national food retailers in the UK, we present statistical evidence on two pricing practices that have attracted public interest. Analysing price dynamics before and after periods of promotional discounting the investigation finds first, no evidence of a general tendency for sales to disguise rises in the regular price, and second, some evidence for prices to rise prior to sales in a manner that is consistent with the exaggeration of the discount.

Abstract: Using a novel application of recurrent event survival analysis for a sample of 84 EC industries, this paper establishes that cartel breakdown is typically followed by intensive merger activity - especially for cartels detected only after they had already broken down, and where concentration was lower. In a number of cases mergers led to the emergence of dominant leading firms while in most markets where mergers did not occur, post-cartel structure was already consistent with dominance. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that mergers are often designed to establish a new market structure conducive to tacit collusion. Surprisingly few mergers were intervened by the competition authority, apparently because many were individually small, but cumulatively had significant impact on concentration.

Abstract: Procurement within the NHS is attracting increasing research and policy interest. However, most of the emphasis has been on the buyer (the NHS), with less attention paid to the behaviour of suppliers (often pharmaceutical companies). For medical devices very little is publicly documented about procurement and even less about the supplying industry. This paper uses a case study of artificial hip prostheses to indirectly explore how procurement choices are made within the NHS. We recognise the roles of the various players (patient, surgeon and hospital procurement department) when purchases are made from a potentially highly oligopolistic supplying industry. Using data from the National Joint Registry for England and Wales, we show that the supplying industry is indeed highly oligopolistic, with the potential for the exercise of market seller power. At the national level the NHS as a whole purchases from the equivalent of just four large sellers. However, typically individual hospitals are buying from only two, or in some instances one seller. Given this backdrop, we develop a theoretical framework explaining prosthesis choice, considering the roles and preferences of the patient, surgeon, hospital and supplier. This provides a set of hypotheses tested using an econometric model in which the diversity of prosthesis choice at the hospital level is explained by a vector of patient and hospital characteristics. This reveals little evidence that patient heterogeneity is a major determinant of diversity of procurement choices. More important are hospital size (which will be related to the number of surgeons), status of the hospital, recent NHS reforms and the potential role of the supplier. These findings provide a basis for future survey analysis of surgeons and hospital procurement departments designed to discover more directly how decisions are made and how suppliers bargain with hospitals.

Abstract: UK governments and the energy regulator have shown increasing concern about the health of competition in the residential energy market, following their pioneering deregulation at the end of the last century. We identify the effects of introducing the non discrimination clauses in 2009, a major regulatory intervention and the first since deregulation. We explore the effect of this intervention on the price movements of the six major players, and find that the nature of competition in the industry has changed, with less effective rivalry between the regional incumbents and large regional competitors following the intervention; companies seem to have ‘retreated’ to their home regions, leaving a market where pricing behaviour resembles more closely a duopoly between British Gas and the regional incumbent

Abstract: Governments and agencies increasingly intervene to influence consumer decisions, both to benefit individual outcomes and to improve market functioning. With a unique data set directly incorporating consumers’ own beliefs about potential gains and the time needed to search and switch across eight markets, we identify separately what motivates consumers to search and switch (or not). Controlling for consumers’ expectations of gain and time needed, intrinsic markets differences and demographic factors, we find persistent variations in consumer responses across individuals and markets. Such variations enable identification of (in)active consumers to target, but challenge the wisdom of imposing uniform regulatory policies. Overall, we conclude that policies which emphasise potential gains and reduce anticipated switching time are the most likely to increase consumer activity, but that policies tailored to particular markets and target groups are necessary to gain maximum effect.

Abstract: Using a unique specially generated data set, we show that the strength of the relationship between search and switching varies across groups of consumers with different attitudes and that the strongest driver of consumer activity is the anticipated gains from switching. The expected length and difficulty of the switching process has little deterrent effect, and factors such as internet use, employment and experience in other markets affect switching behaviour amongst only some groups. Policy makers need to identify these different incentives for various types of consumers if they are to develop effective instruments to stimulate consumer choice and activity.

Abstract: In order to deter collusion and punish the infringement of competition law, anti-trust authorities run costly investigations and levy fines on detected and convicted wrongdoers. Across countries, the resources committed to anti-trust investigations and the fine level vary. According to Becker (1968) different combinations of magnitude of fine and likelihood of detection are substitutable in their deterrence effect. Since detection depends on costly investigation, it is optimal to minimize detection efforts and impose high fines. Recently the UK Office of Fair Trading faced a budget reduction that may affect detection efforts, while it simultaneously increased colluding firms fines from 10% to 30% of its annual turnover. Experimental support for the Beckerian Proposition is mixed in different contexts, and it is not known from a behavioural perspective how effective this type of policy design would be in a market. We address this issue through a market experiment to study the effects of magnitude and likelihood of fines on cartel activity, prices and collusive stability. We find that, in the absence of a leniency program, complying with the Beckerian Proposition, detection rates and fines are indeed substitutable. In the presence of a leniency program, however, a regime that embodies low rates of detection and high fines reduces the propensity to collude and lowers the overall incidence of cartelized markets significantly more than a high detection and low fine regime. This indicates that antitrust agencies can economize on enforcement costs and achieve a higher degree of deterrence by imposing higher level of fines.

Abstract: A series of private competition law cases in the UK has demonstrated that there are significant procedural issues that need to be resolved before private enforcement can take off in the way that the European Commission and the UK Government are currently encouraging. One of these issues is the period of limitations in a follow-on case where there are multiple infringers some of whom appeal the (infringement) decision of the competition authority and some of whom do not. This is an ongoing problem in the UK in the context of follow-on actions before the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) and is currently awaiting resolution by the Supreme Court in Deutsche Bahn. This article shows that this seemingly simple question of period of limitations is in fact loaded with serious implications going well beyond a procedural, timing issue. Although the issue is pertinent to all types of infringements of competition law with multiple infringers, it has particular implications for leniency recipients in cartel cases and therefore, for the overall relationship between private and public enforcement of competition law. These implications demonstrate how far from desirable the current legal situation is. This article demonstrates what the overall preferable solution is regarding the treatment of period of limitations in follow-on cases based on Commission infringement decisions in the presence of multiple infringers from a UK and EU law point of view.

Abstract: Evaluations of competition policy are increasingly common and typically establish that consumer benefits from detected cases easily outweigh the costs of competition authorities (CA). However, such assessments are often driven by data availability and only capture a small part of the total impact because they sidestep the difficult issue of how to evaluate deterrence. Similarly, they ignore the fact that policy does not root out all anti-competitive cases. This paper suggests a broader framework for evaluation which encompasses these unobserved impacts. Calibration is difficult precisely because we cannot rely on empirical observations on cases which have been observed to make deductions about cases which have not (because they are deterred or undetected). It thereby confronts the classic sample selection problem which is endemic in all studies based on data from CA decisions. Drawing on insights from economic theory, it argues that selection bias is likely to be substantial because the unobserved cases could well be those which are most harmful. If so, the deterrence of anti-competitive mergers may have a much greater positive impact, but the effects of non-detected cartels may be more serious than is usually supposed.

Abstract: We study upstream and downstream prices and the profit margin of crude oil in a Southwest-US regional crude oil intermediary market, where oil is transported by motor vehicle. We analyze a proprietary data set that permits a unique account of intermediation in a regional market. This contrasts with existing empirical studies, which rely on national/international level crude oil data that is heavily influenced by macroeconomic and political factors. We estimate panel hedonic models to analyze the effects of geographic variables, the characteristics of bilateral business deals between an intermediary and the upstream and downstream trading partners, and the quality components of the crude oil on prices and margins. Selection bias involving crude oil posted price is accounted for using a standard instrumental variable approach and a Hausman-Taylor instrumental variable approach. Results show that in this market, the characteristics of bilateral business deals and logistic issues have significant effects on oil prices and the profit margin, independent of oil quality. In line with existing results, we find significant effects of quality components such as basic sediment and water, sulfur content, and specific gravity on buying and selling prices and on the profit margin, but only effects of gravity is non-linear.

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between public and private enforcers introducing a more differentiated approach. In contrast to the existing literature, we take into account that the costs and benefits of detection and prosecution and, thus, the usefulness of each enforcement mode may change with a variation of the type of anticompetitive conduct. We define a set of parameters that determine the costs and benefits of both types to enforce the antitrust laws and discuss implications for European competition law and policy.

Abstract: Post-grant validity challenges at patent offices rely on the private initiative of third parties to correct mistakes made by patent offices. We hypothesize that incentives to bring post-grant validity challenges are reduced when many firms benefit from revocation of a patent and when firms are caught up in patent thickets. Using data on opposition against patents at the European Patent Office we show that opposition decreases in fields in which many others profit from patent revocations. Moreover, in fields with a large number of mutually blocking patents the incidence of opposition is sharply reduced, particularly among large firms and firms that are caught up directly in patent thickets. These findings indicate that post-grant patent review may not constitute an effective correction device for erroneous patent grants in technologies affected by either patent thickets or highly dispersed patent ownership.

It also reviews the literature on the economics of (generic) law enforcement, with a focus on self-reporting schemes, for crimes committed either by individuals or groups of individuals. The principal objective of the survey is to enhance our understanding of how leniency policies impact on cartel formation and sustainability.

Abstract: This paper exploits enlargement of the European Union as a natural experiment to provide evidence for cluttering of the trade mark register in Europe. Enlargement increased regulatory uncertainty for pharmaceutical firms because the number of medical regulators that had to approve invented names for pharmaceutical products increased sharply at the time. The effects of this regulatory shock on pharmaceutical firms’ trade mark application strategies are studied using Difference-in-Differences and bias adjusted matching estimators. It is shown that enlargement had a significant and quantitatively important effect on pharmaceutical firms’ incentives to clutter trade mark registers with trade marks they are unlikely to use.

Abstract: When a branded drug manufacturer makes a payment to a potential entrant to delay generic entry it raises anticompetitive concerns. In this paper I highlight one such deal in a subsegment of drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - mixed amphetamine salts (MAS) - and compute market equilibrium prices under three counterfactuals. In the first case, equilibrium prices are computed if all MAS drugs were produced by a single profit maximizing firm, while in the latter two counterfactuals, I compute equilibrium prices when either an immediate release generic or an extended release branded drug are not available in the market. The simulations show that the average percentage increase in drug prices is 4-4.5 times larger in the latter two cases (when a drug is not available in the market) compared to a simple joint profit maximization of the same products. In this respect, the challenges by the Federal Trade Commission to the so called, `pay-to-delay' deals and the recent legislations introduced into the Congress to ban such deals are justified.

Abstract: This paper studies obfuscation decisions by firms in retail financial markets theoretically and experimentally. We show that more prominent firms are more likely to obfuscate. While prominent firms always choose maximum obfuscation, the obfuscation by less prominent firms depends on the degree of asymmetry in prominence and consumer protection policy. We evaluate the impact of a consumer protection policy that limits the scope of obfuscation. We show that such a policy may not be effective as less prominent firms may increase their obfuscation practice.

Abstract: In an experiment on markets for services, we find that consumers are likely to stick to defaults and achieve suboptimal outcomes. We unpack two key psychological reasons why they do this – complexity (in terms of non-linearity, number and bundling of tariffs) and consumer inattention -. The complexity induced by product bundling, non-linearity and number of tariffs has an important role, but this is overstated if the explanatory power of inattention is neglected. We show that a ‘smart nudge’ policy of automatically switching default tariffs can be used to exploit inattention-based consumer inertia to achieve better consumer outcomes.

Abstract: We investigate the lifespan and risk of termination of 790 arm’s length agencies in the United Kingdom over the period 1985 - 2008. We hypothesise that the risk of termination will depend on three groups of factors: factors relating to the rationales for the initial delegation of power to the arm’s length agency and the form of delegation; factors relating to the policy position of the government; and factors relating to the economy. We find that agencies which have a regulatory function (particularly an economic regulation function), and those designed to ensure probity of decision-making are less likely to be terminated in any given year. Agencies structured as executive non-departmental public bodies and non-ministerial departments are also longer-lived than others. Agencies operating under right-wing governments and under heavily indebted governments are more likely to be terminated, although left-wing governments are more sensitive to the effects of debt.

Abstract: Although the study of international cartels has a considerable lineage our understanding of their organization, operation and management remains limited. This study attends to this omission through examining the role of marketing and sales managers within international cartels using a content analysis of 56 major international price-fixing cartels over two decades (1990-2009). It is reported that marketing and sales managers are demonstrably involved in many international cartels (42.9% of all cartel cases), albeit often accompanied by more senior managers from other firm functions. Marketing and sales managers appear most frequently within worldwide and manufacturing industry cartels and where market allocation and customer-sharing practices occur. In light of these findings it is important to reassess both managerial attitudes towards inter-firm collaborations and enhance the position of antitrust concerns within business school syllabi.

Abstract: The concept of a cartel ringleader has specific legal meaning, but has received little attention in the economic literature of cartels. This paper draws on a sample of 89 European cartels to identify how often ringleaders exist, and who they are and what they do. It argues that ringleaders are more likely where the traditional ‘cartel problems’ are likely to be most acute, i.e. with larger numbers of members exhibiting substantial size asymmetries. This is confirmed for price fixing and bid rigging cartels, and is especially pronounced where the ringleader displays ‘aggressive’ as opposed to merely ‘organisational’ behaviour.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effects yielded by the interaction between government regulation policies and parallel trade, with a particular focus on the pharmaceutical sector. We provide a complete welfare analysis that accounts for both global investment decisions in R&D as well as local costly distribution of drugs. We study the patent holder’s decisions when a foreign government can introduce a direct price control to lower the price of patented drugs. We show that, under parallel trade, investment can rise only when the foreign government takes into full account its impact both on investment and on the firm’s decision to supply the regulated country. This arises because of a complete withdrawal from price regulation. The regulated country is however better off under an intermediate form of commitment whereby the foreign government anticipates its effect only on local distribution and delivery, but not on global R&D investment. In this case, the government resorts to some price regulation, which reduces investment in particular under parallel trade.

Abstract: A "reference offer" for Local Loop Unbundling was first published in the UK in December 2000, but by the end of 2005 just 2% of competitive copper access lines used LLU, compared with 56% in France. In 2005 Ofcom, introduced policy changes to commercialise LLU, which has increased to around 70% of competitive copper access lines. This paper measures the impact of Ofcom’s policy changes and concludes that these policy changes induced both the innovation and diffusion of LLU. The paper concludes that it is insufficient for regulators simply to mandate access: they must also ensure commercially attractive, non-discriminatory terms.

Abstract: From the beginning, the debate on the likely results of the proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T focused more on the claims of the parties that "immense" merger efficiencies would overwhelm any apparent losses of competition than on the presence or absence of those losses, and the factors that might affect them, such as market definition. The companies based their "economic model" of the merger on estimates of efficiencies on AT&T"s "engineering model", without addressing the credibility of the results of the latter in the context of the economics literature on the telecommunications sector. In this paper we first argue that the economics literature on economies of scale (especially) and economies of density in mobile telephony suggests caution in expecting such massive cost reductions from increasing the size of an already very large firm. We then present new econometric evidence from an international data base supporting the notion that most large mobile telephone service providers have reached the point of constant or even (rarely) declining returns to scale

Abstract: This paper provides evidence indicating the importance of foreign banks for the industry dynamics in SME lending market. I explore such dynamics by studying interactively the impact of three aspects of the banking market structure on lending to SMEs, including bank size and its distribution, bank market concentration, and foreign bank presence in Eastern European countries. The results show that larger banks are associated with increasing lending to SMEs, but dominance of very large banks (high inequality in bank size) and high concentration are harmful to SMEs. I also find that the negative effect of dominance of large banks and concentration is largely offset, and that the positive impact of banks size is enhanced by increasing foreign bank presence. The results suggest that the industry dynamics with the presence of large foreign bank break down barriers and create more, not less, opportunities for SMEs to be financed.

Abstract: We develop a model wherein collusive firm’s decisions to keep or to destroy the hard evidence is endogenous. Unlike previous literature, we assume that the administration of the cartel crucially depends on the existence of the hard evidence. Within this framework, we explore the impact of a leniency program on whether firm’s incentives are to destroy or keep the hard evidence. Moreover, we examine firm’s incentives to report or not to report the hard evidence to the antitrust authority. We show that firms may be wilfully keep the hard evidence, even if a leniency program is not available, in order to enhance the stability of a cartel. Additionally, we prove that firms are more inclined to keep the hard evidence when a leniency program is available. Finally, we demonstrate that firms are more likely to destroy the hard evidence when the collusive profits-fine ratio increases.

Abstract: This study examines whether there are managerial knowledge spillovers from foreign to domestic banks in Eastern Europe and Latin America, additional to competition effects. I estimate the ’pure’ managerial efficiency teasing out external (environmental) effects in a 3-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) framework. I then examine the evolutionary pattern of foreign and domestic banks’ managerial performance together with that of banking competition. The main results suggest that domestic banks’ managerial performance is positively associated with foreign bank presence. Even during the period when competition is relatively low, domestic banks are catching up with foreign banks. These results suggest the strong possibility of knowledge spillovers in addition to competition effects and call for future direct evidence.

Abstract: The speed of market penetration (i.e. diffusion) is an important summary measure of how well the market works for potential consumers of a new product. This paper identifies the structural features associated with rapid diffusion of mobile telephony. We use a sample of thirty countries over the sixteen years in which average penetration rose from 2% to 97% of the population (earlier studies observed only the initial years of diffusion during which there was typically only one or two networks). We find that the history of market structures matters and five firms maximise the speed of consumer uptake. The market structure effect does not appear to work exclusively through the level of prices. Digital technology, standardisation, privatization and independent regulation are also important positive factors, and we identify the speed and dimensions of catch-up.

Abstract: Regulatory reform of the mobile telecommunications sector has been introduced to improve productivity and competitiveness. We use Data Envelopment Analysis and Stochastic Frontier Analysis, and a second-stage econometric analysis to identify the effect of different aspects of reform on productivity and its constituent parts across twenty-two firms from seven countries over 1998-2007. While measures of firm performance are sensitive to the choice of methodology, we find robust evidence that competition and independent regulation improve firm efficiency. Privatized firms are not necessarily more efficient, but can improve productivity more quickly than their public counterparts.

Abstract: This paper aims at examining whether an increased stringency of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) protection is apt to stimulate international cooperation on research projects between developed and emerging countries. To address this issue, we look both at scientific and technological collaborations within the pharmaceutical domain, and we adopt a gravity framework to assess the impact of the IPR level on bilateral R&D cooperation. The analysis was conducted using data from patent and publication databases, and the results provide a sound test of conflicting theories on IPR enforcement and international collaborations in pharmaceutical research.

Abstract: The standard innovation race specification assumes a memoryless exponential distribution for the time to success of an R&D project. This specification implies that a project succeeds, eventually, with probability one. We introduce a positive probability that an R&D project fails. With this modified specification, we compare the non- cooperative and cooperative R&D in terms of innovation effort, consumer surplus, and net social welfare.

Abstract: The present study provides an analysis of the conditions that led the Dutch competition authority (the NMa) to decide against a temporary antitrust immunity seeking agreement on antitrust grounds. First, a theoretical Bayesian decision framework, that is similar to that of Cooper et al. (2005), is presented to derive the optimal enforcement rule for agreements for which ex ante antitrust immunity is sought. The NMa's decisions are then investigated in an econometric background where those final decisions are linked to various industry characteristics, as the NMa took them into consideration when making its final decision. In doing so, a bivariate Probit model with sample selection is estimated to account for the fact that non-application by firms operating in a specific industry for an exemption might result in significant bias. The econometric results suggest it is more likely that concerted practices are seen as anti-competitive in more competitive and less concentrated industries. Finally, the narrative evidence on the legal and institutional background, and the econometric results are interpreted in light of the theoretical Bayesian decision framework.

Abstract: By analysing an infinitely repeated game where unit costs alternate stochastically between low and high states and where firms follow a price-matching punishment strategy, we demonstrate that the best collusive prices are rigid over time when the two cost levels are sufficiently close. This provides game theoretic support for the results of the kinked demand curve. In contrast to the kinked demand curve it also generates predictions regarding the level and the determinants of the best collusive price, which in turn has implications for the corresponding collusive profits. The relationships between such price rigidity and the expected duration of a high-cost phase, the degree of product differentiation, and the number of firms in the market are also investigated.

Abstract: Cartel ringleaders can apply for amnesty in some jurisdictions (e.g., the E.U.), whereas in others they are excluded (e.g., the U.S.). This paper provides a survey of identified ringleaders in recent European cartel cases and explores theoretically the effect of ringleader exclusion on collusive prices. Our survey shows that (i) cartels often had more than one ringleader, (ii) the role of ringleaders was very diverse and (iii) ringleaders were typically the largest cartel members. Our theoretical analysis reveals that ringleader exclusion leads to higher prices when (iv) the joint profit maximum cannot be sustained under a non-discriminatory leniency policy, (v) antitrust fines depend on individual cartel gains in a nonlinear fashion and (vi) the size distribution of members is sufficiently heterogeneous. These findings support the imposition of antitrust penalties proportional to firm size when ringleaders are excluded from the corporate leniency program.

Abstract: The economic analysis of delay in legal procedures has received considerable attention in the past. Most of these works focus on the determinants of delay in litigation but very little analysis has been dedicated to examining tactical delay caused by the parties to the litigation. This paper offers an empirical example to fill some of this gap by analysing strategic delay in pre-trial administrative litigation. The paper shows that in European merger litigation parties may decide to tactically challenge discovery attempts, which causes a delay that is strategically used to gain more time to settle the case and to avoid a lengthy in-depth investigation, similar to the prediction of Miceli's (1999) theoretical model. This type of delay can be beneficial to merging parties and to society as well.

Abstract: Physical laws mean that it is generally impossible to identify which power stations are exporting to another country, but economic logic offers strong clues. On windy days, Denmark tends to export electricity to its neighbours, and to import power on calm days. Storing electricity in this way thus allows the country to deal with the intermittency of wind generation. We show that this kind of behaviour is theoretically optimal when a region with wind and thermal generation can trade with one based on hydro power. However, annual trends in Denmark's trade follow its output of thermal generation and are inversely related to Nordic production of hydro power and the amount of water available to Scandinavian generators, with no correlation with wind generation. We estimate the cost of volatility in Denmark's wind output to equal between 4% and 8% of its market value.

Abstract: Theories of regulation in the public interest have emphasized the role of governments either in fixing market failures to promote greater efficiency, or in restricting the efficient functioning of markets in order to pursue public welfare goals. In either case, features of markets serve to justify regulatory intervention. I argue that this causal logic must sometimes be reversed; that, for certain areas of regulation, its function must be understood as making markets legitimate. Based on a comparative historical study of consumer credit markets in the United States and France, I examine the sources of national regulatory divergence. In each case, a series of regulatory interventions by the state transformed a formerly disreputable small lending sector into a legitimate economic activity. But logic of this transformation was very different in the two cases. In the United States, consumer credit was interpreted as a form of welfare policy. In France, consumer credit was seen as a threat that generated inflation and reduced consumer purchasing power. This paper traces the emergence of these different legitimating narratives.

We analyze individual-level data on ad exposure and weekly purchases at this retailer, both online and in stores. We find statistically and economically significant impacts of the advertising on sales. The treatment effect persists for weeks after the end of an advertising campaign, and the total effect on revenues is estimated to be more than seven times the retailer's expenditure on advertising during the study. Additional results explore differences in the number of advertising impressions delivered to each individual, online and offline sales, and the effects of advertising on those who click the ads versus those who merely view them. Power calculations show that, due to the high variance of sales, our large number of observations brings us just to the frontier of being able to measure economically significant effects of advertising. We also demonstrate that without an experiment, using industry-standard methods based on endogenous crosssectional variation in advertising exposure, we would have obtained a wildly inaccurate estimate of advertising effectiveness.

Abstract: The paper analyses the role of injunctions in the private enforcement of competition law. Most commentators deal predominantly with damages actions and the European policy proposals only discuss the conditions for successful compensation claims. However, damages claims are likely to be the most expensive and time consuming remedy available. In many cases injunctive relief may be cheaper and, thus, be preferred by the victim. Asking the court to order the perpetrator to either cease from certain behaviour or to undertake certain actions, plaintiffs might be willing to forego compensation in exchange for a quicker dispute solution with effect for the future. The variety and flexibility of injunctive relief - injunctions can be granted on a preliminary basis or permanently, contain a prohibition or being mandatory - provides victims of anticompetitive conduct with a multi-functional tool to seek relief. The paper compares the usage of and the legal framework for injunctive relief in England and Wales and Germany. The antitrust litigation data available for both jurisdictions indicate that the use of injunctive relief in English and German courts differs greatly. Analysing the legal framework for injunctive relief, I will look at the judicial approach that is taken with respect to injunctions and the possible reason for a varying usage of this remedy.

Abstract: Reliable estimates of crime detection rates could help design better sanctions and improve our understanding of the efficiency of law enforcement. For cartels, insufficient knowledge on the rate of discovery has hindered effective enforcement in the past. In comparison to previous works, this paper offers a more parsimonious and simple-to-use method to estimate time dependent cartel discovery rates, whilst allowing for heterogeneity across firms and markets. It draws on capture-recapture methods, similar to those used to make inferences on various wildlife population characteristics in ecology. An application of this method provides evidence that less than one fifth of all cartels are discovered.

Abstract: We develop a model of remedy offers made to an expert agency which has powers to act before any harm is experienced and is required to decide on the basis of tangible evidence. The model provides a relationship between the factors determining the probability of delay and the type of error in early settlements (i.e. insufficient versus excessive remedy). We apply the model using data from European Commission merger settlements. Our econometric analysis confirms the importance of delay costs and the uncertainty associated with the agency's findings. Our results are also consistent with the prediction that delay is not systematically related to the inherent competitive harm of the merger proposal. We use our results to identify specific cases of insufficient remedy in early settlements.

Abstract: This paper uses a market equilibrium model to calculate how the mix of generating capacity would change if large amounts of intermittent renewables are built in Great Britain, and what this means for operatingpatterns and the distribution of prices over time. If generators bid  their marginal costs, we find that the changes to the capacity mix are much greater than the changes to the pattern of prices. Thermal capacity falls only slightly in response to the extra wind capacity, and there is a shift towards power stations with higher variable costs (but lower fixed costs). The changes to the pattern of prices, once capacity has adjusted, are relatively small. In an oligopolistic setting, strategic generators will choose lower levels of capacity. If wind output does not receive the market price, then mark-ups on thermal generation will be lower in a system with large amounts of wind power.

Abstract: Green electricity tariffs are a means by which ‘green consumers' can contribute to investment in renewable energy. In order to conceptualize factors constraining the adoption of green electricity tariffs this paper develops a model that links the willingness-to-pay (WTP) literature with the established innovation diffusion literature. This concern arises from a need to reconcile the large disparities that have been empirically observed between the proportion of households actually adopting green electricity tariffs and the proportion in WTP surveys that claim they would (Stated-Willingness-to-Adopt or SWA). Using the Bass Model as the point of departure our model depicts how increasing consumer environmental concern, driven by word-of-mouth and mass media communication channels, results in an increasing proportion of households with a SWA. The presence of response bias and the free rider problem result in 'feasible adoption' being below the SWA. Feasible adoption is, in turn, differentiated from actual adoption by the extent of market imperfections, such as the supply side problems and regulatory failures often discussed in the empirical literature.

Abstract: Despite its economic significance, competition law still remains fragmented, lacking an international framework allowing for dispute settlement. This, together with the growing importance of non-free-market economies in world trade require us to re-consider and re-evaluate the possibilities of bringing an antitrust suit against a foreign state. If the level playing field on the global marketplace is to be achieved, the possibility of hiding behind the bulwark of state sovereignty should be minimised. States should not be free to act in an anticompetitive way, but at present the legal framework seems ill-equipped to handle such challenges. This paper deals with the defences available in litigation concerning transnational anticompetitive agreements involving or implicating foreign states. Four important legal doctrines are analysed: non-justiciability (political question doctrine), state immunity, act of state doctrine and foreign state compulsion. The paper addresses also the general problem of applicability of competition laws to a foreign state as such. This is a tale about repetitive unsuccessful efforts to sue OPEC and recent attempts in the US to deal with export cartels of Chinese state-owned enterprises.

Abstract: The speed of market penetration (i.e. diffusion) is an important summary measure of how well the market works for potential consumers of a new product. This paper identifies the structural features associated with rapid diffusion of mobile telephony. We use a sample of thirty countries over the sixteen years in which average penetration rose from 2% to 97% of the population (earlier studies observed only the initial years of diffusion during which there was typically only one or two networks). We find a non-monotonic effect of market structure, with three firms maximising consumer uptake. Privatization and independent regulation are also important positive factors. Further results show that the market structure effect works only partially through the level of prices.

Abstract: This article investigates how the use of contracts that condition discounts on the share a supplier receives of a retailer's total purchases (market-share contracts) may affect market outcomes. The case of a dominant supplier that distributes its product through retailers that also sell substitute products is considered. It is found that when the supplier's contracts can only depend on how much a retailer purchases its product (own-supplier contracts), both intra- and inter-brand competition cannot simultaneously be dampened. However, competition on all goods can simultaneously be dampened when market-share contracts are feasible. Compared to ownsupplier contracts, the use of market-share contracts increases the dominant supplier's profit and, if demand is linear, lowers consumer surplus and welfare.

Abstract: The paper offers an empirical analysis of private antitrust enforcement in Germany based on cases that were decided by courts between 2005 and 2007. The study presents information about the magnitude and nature of civil antitrust actions in Germany. The data includes inter alia, information about the courts involved in litigation, the relationship of the parties, affected industries, the remedies sought, the outcome of the claim, the alleged anticompetitive conduct, the proportion of stand-alone and follow-on litigation, and the length of proceedings before a given court. The study shows that a large number of private cases were concluded even when compared with public investigations in Germany. It seems that private antitrust actions complement rather than duplicate public enforcement efforts because of the overwhelming proportion of stand-alone claims and the amount of actions based on the abuse of market power. Only a small number of litigants asked for the compensation of loss suffered from anticompetitive conduct. Interpreting the results from the study cautiously, the paper suggests that the European Commission and other stakeholders may have misunderstood the nature of private actions in Germany (and maybe Europe) and, consequently, asked the wrong question, focusing on compensation. Expensive damages actions for the breach of the antitrust rules might not be as important as commonly assumed.

Abstract: We consider a model in which firms use resale price maintenance (RPM) to dampen competition. We find that even though the motive for using RPM is thus anticompetitive, market forces may limit the overall adverse impact on consumers. Indeed, we find that when there are a large number of firms in the market, consumer welfare under a laissez-faire policy might be as high or almost as high as it would be under an alternative policy in which RPM is banned. Government interventions that put an upper limit on the extent of industry-wide adoption of RPM can have adverse welfare effects in the model. We further show that proposed guidelines in the United States and Europe may come close to minimizing welfare.

Abstract: As long as there is no effective state aid control outside the EU, the European Commission faces a dilemma: either European firms will be disadvantaged in global competition by strict EU rules, or the Commission will come under pressure to relax the rules, thereby running the risk that fair competition within the EU will be undermined. As a consequence, the Commission attempts to promote EU rules on state aid and public procurement beyond EU borders – in non-member countries as well as at the WTO level. This article analyses the Commission's channels of regulatory transfer and the factors accounting for its varying success. Bilateral cooperation provides many opportunities to spread European state aid rules, but decentralised enforcement at the national level remains ultimately deficient. Moreover, the transfer of European rules to the multilateral WTO depends heavily on the EU's ability to reach prior consensus with its most powerful partner and rival, the US Government

Abstract: Evidence from the market for flue-gas desulfurization devices [scrubbers] in the U.S. is used to show that the choice and stringency of environmental regulation have substantial effects on the mark-up of an abatement technology. The imperfectly competitive upstream eco-industry charges higher prices for scrubbers to power plants participating in Phase I of the tradable permit scheme for sulphur dioxide than to those subject to emission standards. The mark-up also depends on stringency of the emission standard, geographic location and electricity market regulation. Previous empirical studies neglect this source of endogeneity. Market power and price discrimination have repercussions on the rate of diffusion and innovation incentives.

Abstract: The paper presents an experiment testing the hypothesis that, if consumers do not have well defined preferences and as a result their valuation of a new product is shaped by past experiences of prices, it may be more profitable for firms to follow a strategy of pricing high and then lower. We ran an individual choice experiment with a posted offer market setup, where different dynamic pricing strategies were implemented. We find evidence of preference shaping and the profitability of a 'high low' pricing strategy under a wide range of assumptions.

Abstract: Recent years have seen growing academic interest in the concept of induced diffusion as efforts to address concerns about energy security and climate change have intensified. Research on induced diffusion explores whether policy tools or interventions can incentivise the diffusion of innovations. This body of knowledge has explored the effectiveness and efficiency of various policy interventions and as such has been concerned with the determinants of diffusion. This paper is, by way of contrast, concerned with the patterns of diffusion when diffusion is induced. Thus, using two datasets, the paper explores the patterns of international wind energy diffusion in OECD countries. The model employed in the paper predicted that wind energy, as a complex and expensive innovation, would exhibit the characteristics of a logistic diffusion curve rather than a loglogistic curve. The empirical modelling of these two curves shows that, consistent with a further proposition developed in the paper, the results are no way near as conclusive as those of earlier studies. These results imply that the patterns of induced diffusion are considerably different to those observed conventionally.

Abstract: We analyse an endogenous prize all-pay auction under complete information where it is possible that none of the bidders wins and the winning payoff becomes non-monotonic in own bid. We derive the conditions for the existence of pure strategy equilibria and fully characterize the unique mixed strategy equilibrium when pure strategy equilibria do not exist. The highvaluation bidder places two distinct mass points in his equilibrium mixed strategy and the equilibrium support of the low-valuation bidder is not continuous. Under common valuation, in the equilibrium mixed strategy both bidders place mass points at the same point of the support. Possible applications are discussed.

Abstract: We use a Tullock-type contest model to show that intuitively and structurally different contests can be strategically and revenue equivalent to each other. We consider a two-player contest, where outcome-contingent payoffs are linear functions of prizes, own effort, and the effort of the rival. We identify strategically equivalent contests that generate the same family of best response functions and, as a result, the same revenue. However, two strategically equivalent contests may yield different equilibrium payoffs. Finally, we discuss possible contest design applications and avenues for future theoretical and empirical research.

Abstract: A dominant firm can abuse its position by charging unfair prices under EU competition law. Among other things, this prohibition has been used to prohibit excessive prices that are 'too high'. This abuse has remained underdeveloped conceptually and in practice at the EU level, so there is ambiguity regarding what constitutes an excessive and therefore unfair price. We consider whether the principle of dual entitlement can be used to define explicitly what constitutes an 'unfair price' in terms of the second stage of the United Brands test. We show that in general this principle is in line with the goals of an effective prohibition of excessive pricing and develop a procedure that defines a price as 'unfair' in terms of this principle. We also show that the case law highlights that European Competition Law enforcers have implicitly followed similar steps as the ones developed here in their attempts to define 'unfair prices'. The procedure could be used explicitly to improve the ex ante legal certainty of the test of 'unfair pricing', which in turn may lead to a more effective prohibition if it is used appropriately with suitable remedies.

Title: Unilateral versus Coordinated Effects: Comparing the Impact on Consumer Welfare of Alternative Merger Outcomes

Abstract: The nature of tacitly collusive behaviour often makes coordination unstable, and this may result in periods of breakdown, during which consumers benefit from reduced prices. This is allowed for by adding demand uncertainty to the Compte et al. (2002) model of tacit collusion amongst asymmetric firms. Breakdowns occur when a firm cannot exclude the possibility of a deviation by a rival. It is then possible that an outcome with collusive behaviour, subject to long/frequent break downs, can improve consumer welfare compared to an alternative with sustained unilateral conduct. This is illustrated by re-examining the Nestle/Perrier merger analyzed by Compte et al., but now also taking into account the potential for welfare losses arising from unilateral behaviour.

Abstract: There is considerable debate about the alternative economic approaches to merger control taken by competition authorities. However, differences in economic analysis are not the only reason for alternative decisions. We conduct an experiment in decision making in the context of merger appraisal, identifying the separate influences of different standards of proof, volumes of evidence, cost of error and professional training. The experiment was conducted on current practitioners from nine different jurisdictions, in addition to student subjects. We find that legal standards of proof significantly affect decisions, and identify specific differences due to professional judgment. We are further able to narrow the range of explanations for why professionalization matters.

Title: The determinants of merger litigation strategies: An empirical analysis of EC mergers
Author-Name: Peter Ormosi
Author-X-Name-First: Peter
Author-X-Name-Last: Ormosi
Author-Workplace-Name: Centre for Competition Policy, University of East Anglia
Abstract: Mergers with anticompetitive effects can gain regulatory approval if they prove that the benefits of the merger outweigh the negative effects (efficiency defence), and/or if they offer to modify the merger transaction in a way that eliminates these adverse effects (merger remedy). Although these two merger control instruments have been analysed separately, little work has been dedicated to modelling merger litigation where both the provision of efficiency-related evidence and remedy-offers are at the merging firms discretion, which is the case for example in the EC. This paper is an attempt to fill the empirical part of this gap. Its novelty lies not only in empirically modelling the system of decisions that firms face in merger litigation but in using data from company reports on the merger-generated synergy expectations signalled to shareholders, which allows the direct empirical testing of some of the assumptions and findings from previous works. Evidence is presented that firms' own efficiency expectations do not have an impact on the probability of applying for efficiency defence; that pre-merger synergy expectations enhance the willingness to offer remedies; false efficiency claims can be distinguished by looking at the timing of the remedyoffer; and finally, the cost of delay plays a central role in designing firms' litigation strategy, especially when these costs exceed the cost of the remedy.

Author-Name: Peter L. Ormosi
Author-X-Name-First: Peter
Author-X-Name-Last: Ormosi
Author-Workplace-Name: Centre for Competition Policy, University of East Anglia
Abstract: This article proposes an empirical method for finding the determinants of the size of remedy offers relative to the level required by the European Commission in individual cases. Evidence is presented that merger characteristics, such as the size of the transaction, or the number of horizontal overlaps do not affect the probability of a remedy offer being successful. It is also shown that pre-merger expectations about merger-generated efficiencies increase the likelihood of successful offers. These findings are very important features of EC merger control, and a novelty in the existing literature. If parties are delay-averse, then the complexity of the case matters very little, as merging parties appear to be able to offer something outright acceptable for the Commission. This may lead to a counter-productive situation where less delay-averse mergers become more prone to offering too much, which can result in over-fixing the competition problem for those mergers where savings would be more likely.

Abstract: This article looks at the distribution of two EC merger procedural events and examines the effect of the indefinite-length suspension of merger investigations. Although the ECMR refers to the suspension of investigations as an exceptional instrument, it is used in a high proportion of cases. As the ECMR does not set a time limit for suspension, it can lead to significant delay in the assessment of mergers. To understand the causes of delay, this article relies on the fact that the suspension of the investigation is a consequence of merging parties' failure to provide the necessary information to the Commission. Two main causes of this behaviour are identified. Firstly, merging parties may decide to intentionally withhold information in order to cause the suspension of the investigation, which allows them more time to do whatever is necessary to avoid a lengthy second phase investigation. Secondly, failure to provide the required information to the Commission may be a result of merging parties' negligence towards the regulatory assessment of their merger. Whereas the first case may be socially beneficial, identifying the second type of behaviour may help in filtering out inefficient mergers.

Abstract: Cartel practices attract enormous corporate fines, even where they only involve a handful of employees. Internal compliance programmes are thought to protect firms by training employees and auditing their activities. However, this paper argues that such programmes are ineffective because cartelists typically know what they are doing is illegal, go to great lengths to avoid detection and are usually senior managers. Moreover, compliance programmes do not mitigate cartel fines, despite their being imposed on the whole corporation years after an infringement has occurred. It is argued that the threat of criminal sanctions against individuals is essential to effective internal compliance.

Abstract: This paper examines the joint pricing of credit insurance and unsecured lending. This case has wider regulatory implications following concerns that the sale of credit insurance as a secondary or add-on product has resulted in uncompetitive pricing, limited product utility and possible misselling. To explore these concerns a theoretical model is developed in which banks set prices for customers who have varying decision making ability. The model predictions are tested empirically. It is concluded that banks crosssubsidise unsecured lending by setting high credit insurance premiums. The form of sales and profit maximising by banks is central to causing such a cross-subsidy to arise. This cross-subsidy is observed to decline over time and is far more pronounced for proprietary rather than mutually owed banks.

Title: Can the Commission use Article 82EC to Combat Tacit Collusion?

Abstract: Recent events suggest that Article 82 may prohibit abusive and tacitly collusive conduct. Yet can the Commission enforce this law? In this article I argue it cannot. I tackle this question of enforcement from the perspective of proof and examine to what extent the Commission can establish the conduct of tacit collusion. I show that proof of tacit collusion requires the Commission to overcome a difficult problem of identification, notably how to distinguish tacit collusion from other very subtle conducts like unconscious parallelism and undetected overt collusion. I argue that the Commission cannot resolve this problem by establishing the typical conditions drawn from case law, such as the lack of effective competition, the Airtours criterion and a focal point, as this proof cannot mitigate error sufficiently. This seeks the Commission to produce greater cogency of evidence, yet only at the expense of rendering enforcement prohibitively onerous. I conclude that owing to a problem of proof (detection) Article 82 is unenforceable and can neither punish nor deter tacit collusion. This makes a policy of using Article 82 to combat tacit collusion ex post misconceived and suggests that tacit collusion admits only an ex ante legal treatment.

Abstract: The aims of this paper are twofold. First, I explain the economics of bank bailouts as distinct from bailouts for other sectors of the economy. Why do all the rules of good competition policy appear to fly out of the window when the banks get into trouble? Does this mean that we should abandon the rules equally for car manufacturers and other industries in trouble? I argue that a unique combination of two characteristics make it essential to bailout or nationalise the banks in the current crisis. No other sector of the economy can claim the same justification. Second, I review the threat of a retreat to politically-determined industrial policy and the need for vigilant implementation of economic effects-based competition policy.

Abstract: It is well known that search costs and switching costs can create market power by constraining the ability of consumers to change suppliers. While previous research has examined each cost in isolation, this paper demonstrates the benefits of examining the two types of friction in unison. The paper shows how subtle distinctions between the two costs can provide important differences in their effects upon consumer behaviour, competition and welfare. In addition, the paper also illustrates a simple empirical methodology for estimating separate measures of both costs, while demonstrating a potential bias that can arise if only one cost is considered.

Abstract: This study examines if, and how, branding constitutes an anticompetitive act. These questions are assessed through an examination of UK competition cases undertaken over the period 1950-2007. From this assessment it is observed that branding can facilitate excessive pricing, requires vertical restraints, and can lead to consumer confusion. Competition cases focused on branding issues are demonstrably different from cases without branding concerns and involve larger, often manufacturing, firms, which operate in more concentrated markets. It is concluded that competition law needs to be disseminated more widely amongst business communities. This will require greater prominence for competition policy within business school syllabi and greater reference to business and management theory on the part of competition law agencies would assist the comprehension of business techniques such as branding.

Title: Exploitative Abuse in Article 82EC: Back to Basics?

Abstract: For the last few years, the EC Commission has been reviewing its application of Article 82EC which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position on the Common Market. The review has resulted in a Communication from the EC Commission which for the first time sets out its enforcement priorities under Article 82EC. The review had been limited to the so-called 'exclusionary' abuses and excluded 'exploitative' abuses; the enforcement priorities of the EC Commission set out in the Guidance (2008) are also limited to 'exclusionary' abuses. This is, however, odd since the EC Commission expresses the objective of Article 82EC as enhancing consumer welfare: exploitative abuses can directly harm consumers unlike exclusionary abuses which can only indirectly harm consumers as the result of exclusion of competitors. This paper questions whether and under which circumstances exploitation can and/or should be found 'abusive'. It argues that 'exploitative' abuse can and should be used as the test of anticompetitive effects on the market under an effects-based approach and thus conduct should only be found abusive if it is 'exploitative'. Similarly, mere exploitation does not demonstrate harm to competition and without the latter, exploitation on its own should not be found abusive.

Abstract: This study examines the impacts of reforms - privatization, new entry and independent regulatory authority - on mobile network penetration and expansion using a new and hitherto unused panel dataset for 30 national mobile markets (i.e. 29 OECD countries and China) over the time period 1991-2006 under a 3-equation econometric framework. The estimation results confirm that introducing new entry is, in general, positively correlated with mobile network penetration and expansion; and in particular, the third entry brings many more benefits than the second one. The results also highlight the crucial role of an independent regulator in privatized mobile markets. Especially, the dynamic estimation results suggest that without an independent regulator, privatization is, on average, negatively correlated with mobile network expansion, even in certain competitive market environments.

Title: 'Consumer' versus 'Customer': the Devil in the Detail

Abstract: The ultimate objective of EC competition rules is arguably the enhancement of 'consumer welfare'. In EC competition law, however, 'consumer' merely means 'customer'. Not being limited to final consumers, the concept also encompasses intermediate customers. Moreover, according to the EC Commission, under Article 82EC, harm to intermediate customers is generally presumed to create harm to consumers and where intermediate customers are not competitors of the dominant undertaking, there is no requisite to assess the effects of conduct on users further downstream. This paper questions the appropriateness of this presumption in light of recent advances in economics, specifically that of vertical restraints and in particular non-linear pricing. It uses this literature to show that there are many instances where an increase (decrease) in 'customer welfare' does not cause an increase (decrease) in 'consumer welfare'. In these cases, the presumption is devoid of economic justification and likely to lead to decisional errors. The paper concludes that if the law is to serve the interests of 'real' consumers, the EC Commission should reconsider this presumption and its interpretation of the 'consumer' in 'consumer welfare'. Until then, it remains questionable and objectionable whose interests EC competition law and in particular, Article 82EC, serve.

Abstract: We describe a first experiment on whether product complexity affects competition and consumers in retail markets. We are unable to detect a significant effect of product complexity on prices, except insofar as the demand elasticity for complex products is higher. However, there is qualified evidence that complex products have the potential to induce consumers to buy more than they would otherwise. In this sense, consumer exploitability in quantities cannot be ruled out. We also find evidence for shaping effects: consumers' preferences are shaped by past experience with prices, and firms may in principle exploit this to sell more.

Abstract: It is conventional wisdom that collusion is more likely the fewer firms there are in a market and the more symmetric they are. This is often theoretically justified in terms of a repeated non-cooperative game. Although that model fits more easily with tacit than overt collusion, the impression sometimes given is that 'one model fits all'. Moreover, the empirical literature offers few stylised facts on the most simple of questions – how few are few and how symmetric is symmetric? This paper attempts to fill this gap while also exploring the interface of tacit and overt collusion, albeit in an indirect way. First, it identifies the empirical model of tacit collusion that the European Commission appears to have employed in coordinated effects merger cases – apparently only fairly symmetric duopolies fit the bill. Second, it shows that, intriguingly, the same story emerges from the quite different experimental literature on tacit collusion. This offers a stark contrast with the findings for a sample of prosecuted cartels; on average, these involve six members (often more) and size asymmetries among members are often considerable. The indirect nature of this 'evidence' cautions against definitive conclusions; nevertheless, the contrast offers little comfort for those who believe that the same model does, more or less, fit all.

Abstract: I consider a Vickrey-Salop model of spatial product differentiation with quasi-linear utility functions and contrast two modes of production, the proprietary model where entrepreneurs sell software to the users, and the open source model where users participate in software development. I show that the OS model of production may be more efficient from the point of view of welfare than the proprietary model, but that an OS industry is vulnerable to entry by entrepreneurs while a proprietary industry can resist entry by OS projects. A mixed industry where OS and proprietary development methods coexist may exhibit large OS projects cohabiting with more specialized proprietary projects, and is more efficient than the proprietary model of production from the point of view of welfare.

Abstract: The health sector reform programme which began in Vietnam in 1989 in order to improve the efficiency of the health system has altered the way in which Vietnamese hospitals operate. The programme put the spotlight on input savings. This study aims to examine the relative efficiency of hospitals during the health reform process and assess – by looking at the relative efficiency of hospitals – the effects of the regulatory changes. The study employs the DEA two-stage approach referring to data from 101 general public hospitals over the period 1998-2006. The study revealed that there was evidence of improvement in the productivity of Vietnamese hospitals over the period 1998-2006, with a progress in total factor productivity of 1.4% per year. Furthermore, the differences in hospital efficiency can be attributed to both the regulatory changes and hospital-specific characteristics. The user fees and autonomy measures were found to increase technical efficiency. Provincial hospitals were revealed to be more technically efficient than their central counterparts and hospitals located in the North East, South East and Mekong River Delta regions performed better than hospitals from other regions.

Abstract: The combination of leniency programmes, high sanctions, complaints from customers and private actions for damages, has proven very successful at uncovering and punishing cartel agreements in the US. Countless jurisdictions are being encouraged to adopt these 'conventional' enforcement tools, in the absence of an international competition authority. The purpose of this paper is to widen the debate on cartel enforcement by identifying three issues which can undermine their effectiveness in some jurisdictions: (1) Corruption and organised crime; (2) Social norms that are sympathetic to collusive practices; (3) Collectivist business cultures built on personal relationships.

Abstract: Previous empirical assessments of the effectiveness of structural merger remedies have focused mainly on the subsequent viability of the divested assets. Here, we take a different approach by examining how competitive are the market structures which result from the divestments. We employ a tightly specified sample of markets in which the European Commission (EC) has imposed structural merger remedies. It has two key features: (i) it includes all mergers in which the EC appears to have seriously considered, simultaneously, the possibility of collective dominance, as well as single dominance; (ii) in a previous paper, for the same sample, we estimated a model which proved very successful in predicting the Commission's merger decisions, in terms of the market shares of the leading firms. The former allows us to explore the choices between alternative theories of harm, and the latter provides a yardstick for evaluating whether markets are competitive or not – at least in the eyes of the Commission.

Abstract: Fighting collusion has long been a challenge in organizaions, whilst favoritism in organizations has long been attacked as one of the most important sources of workplace conflicts. This paper links the phenomena of collusion and favoritism together which seem to be irrelevant. We show that favoritism cannot benefit organizations where collusion is not a serious concern, meanwhile explicit favoritism can bring conflicts among collusive subordinates and undermine the efficiency of collusion, therefore it is effective in fighting collusion.

Abstract: Many retailers promise that they will not be undersold by rivals (price-matching guarantees) and extend their promise to include their own future prices (most-favoured-customer clauses). This is puzzling because the extant literature has shown that each promise independently has the potential to facilitate supracompetitive prices, and so one might think that the two promises are substitutes. In this paper, we consider why a firm might make both promises in the same guarantee, and show that price-matching guarantees and most-favoured-customer clauses complement each other and can lead to higher prices than either one could have facilitated by itself.

Abstract: This paper questions whether the objective of Article 82EC is indeed enhancing 'consumer welfare' as suggested by the EC Commission when one examines the application of the provision thus far. It critically analyses the case law of the EC Commission and Courts to show that there is  great dissonance between the practice and the policy declarations on the provision. When one considers the practice alongside the rhetoric, Article 82EC appears as a provision enforced without a clear standard of harm leading to doubts about the legitimacy of enforcement. The article suggests that without a properly defined standard applied in actual decisions by the EC Commission and upheld by the EC Courts, the modernisation of Article 82EC cannot succeed.

Abstract: The House of Lords judgment in Inntrepreneur v Crehan, where the court did not consider itself bound by a finding of the European Commission, demonstrated the potentially contentious and constitutionally significant nature of the relationship between the European Commission and national judges in the field of antitrust. The decentralisation of enforcement of Articles 81 and 82EC arguably carries greater risks of divergent application of EC antitrust enforcement rules. While national competition authorities are linked through the European Competition Network, no such mechanism exists for national courts as this would offend against the principles of judicial independence and procedural autonomy. The Commission, as primary enforcer of competition law in the Community, has therefore attempted to complement the formal judicial 'dialogue' of the European Court of Justice's preliminary reference procedure with a strengthening of its own relations with the national courts. After addressing the broader theoretical context of administrative intervention in judicial decision-making, this paper examines the use of one tool to promote consistent application of EC antitrust rules - non-binding European Commission opinions and amicus curiae briefs to national courts in antitrust proceedings under Article 15 of the Modernisation Regulation. It identifies national cases where the Commission has actually intervened under Article 15 and assesses the nature and efficacy of this soft law mechanism. One finding is the difficulty in finding and tracing the cases, making the impact of the Commission's advice difficult to judge. Transparency is desirable for legitimacy, legal certainty, and if Commission opinions are to have the most impact for promoting convergent application of EC antitrust rules among national judges.

Abstract: This paper examines one of the most important marketing strategies by software producers on the Internet. That is whether to offer free samples and if so, whether to list the samples on shareware repositories. I show that  rms with higher value products have a greater incentive to offer free samples but are more reluctant to do so if they are well known, and even when they do are less likely to be listed on shareware repositories. I then proceed to use four types of Probit-based models to corroborate the findings from the theoretical model.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of dynamic indefinite horizon R and D races with uncertainty and multiple prizes. The theoretical predictions are highly sensitive: small parameter changes determine whether technological competition is sustained, or converges into a market structure with an entrenched leadership and lower aggregate R and D. The subjects' strategies are far less sensitive. In most treatments, the R and D races tend to converge to entrenched leadership. Investment is highest when rivals are close. This stylized fact, and so the usefulness of neck-to-neck competition in general, is largely unrelated to rivalry concerns but can be explained using a quantal response extension of Markov perfection.

Abstract: This papers incorporates the economic theory of organizations into the framework of public law enforcement, and characterizes the dual-coalition structure of cartel organisation that allows us to highlight the strategic interactions between cartel participants under different antitrust policies. We show that delegation of authorities over collusive decisions from top executives to subordinates can mitigate the temptation of renege on collusive relationships and thus contributes to facilitating collusion. This result parallels the insights in Baker, Gibbons and Murphy (2002, 2006) which find that the optimal allocation of decision rights is to minimize the maximum temptation to renege on relational contracts. Moreover, the efficiency gains of delegation in facilitating collusion can be mitigated when the corporate leniency program is introduced, in particular whenever it is unlikely to detect cartels absent leniency and the corporate liability is much significant than individual liability.

Abstract: This paper examines Norwegian gasoline pump prices using daily station-specific observations from March 2003 to March 2006. Whereas studies that have analyzed similar price cycles in other countries find support for the Edgeworth cycle theory (Maskin and Tirole, 1988), we demonstrate that Norwegian gasoline price cycles involve a form of coordinated behavior. We also show that gasoline prices follow a fixed weekly pattern, with prices increasing significantly every Monday at noon, and that gasoline companies appear to use the recommended price as a coordination device with a fixed link between the retail and recommended prices. Moreover, the weekly pattern changed in April 2004; whereas Thursday had been the high-price day, Monday now became the high-price day. The price–cost margin also increased significantly after the weekly pattern changed in April 2004.

Title: The UK Cartel Offence: Lame Duck or Black Mamba?

Abstract: A criminal offence requiring Ghosh dishonesty was introduced in the UK by the Enterprise Act 2002, primarily to enhance cartel deterrence as a complement to corporate fines. Yet the first convictions resulted from a US plea bargain in 2008. This paper identifies three obstacles to enhancing deterrence through the cartel offence. First, Norris v USA and a public survey suggest relatively weak perceptions of cartels persist in the UK. It was envisaged that convictions would remedy this, but prosecutors will continue to be very selective about the cases they bring to trial if there are doubts as to whether price fixing alone is viewed as objectively dishonest. Secondly, any increase in criminal enforcement risks discouraging leniency applications to the European Commission, because corporate immunity granted on the Community level does not automatically protect employees from criminal prosecution in national courts. There is also no conclusive mechanism for direct settlement, as there is in the US. Thirdly, sizeable benefits and purportedly low detection rates mean deterrence may be weak if custodial sentences do not become the norm. Further sanctions such as Director Disqualification Orders can play an important role in ensuring cartelists do not seek immediate reemployment at a high level.

Abstract: We develop a simple framework for analyzing the optimal design of leniency programs, which allow cartel members to denounce their collusive agreements. We highlight a basic trade-off between two opposite forces: leniency can destabiliza cartels, by encouraging firms to report and bring evidence to the antitrust authority, but it can also reduce the expected penalties that cartel members face. We characterize the optimal leniency rates, both before any investigation and once an investigation is opened, and show that these two leniency opportunities are particularly useful when random investigations are unfrequent and/or unlikely to succeed in the absence of self-reporting; we also compare the effectiveness of alternative rules for late informants and repeated offenders.

Abstract: This paper provides an assessment of EC merger policy from three perspectives. First, it places the evolution of merger policy alongside the evolution of economic ideas in relation to competition and industrial organisation. Second, it highlights recent developments in the practical economic appraisal of competition in four areas: unilateral (non-coordinated) effects, particularly the appropriate use of simulation techniques and the efficiency defence; coordinated effects (collective dominance), particularly the role of the Community Courts; non-horizontal effects, particularly the need for the new guidelines; and remedies, particularly weaknesses in current practice. Third, it develops a simple bargaining approach to merger policy evaluation to draw conclusions about the trend in overall effectiveness of EC merger policy since 1989.

Abstract: Event study analysis is a branch of econometrics which attempts to measure the effects of economic events on the value of firms by examining stock market data. Providing that share prices reflect the underlying economic values of assets, changes in equity values will properly capture expected changes in the economic profitability of the firm. This paper considers the effect on stock prices of announcements relevant to Competition Commission references, using established event study methodology.

Abstract: Competition Authorities are introducing new informational remedies to help consumers search and switch more actively. Using a specially commissioned data set, and unique direct estimates of the gains, search and switching time which consumers anticipate, we examine the determinants of consumer activity in eight markets. We find that expected costs (and to some extent gains) do influence consumers as a utility maximising model would predict; but that their role is small, and other factors, particularly experience of switching in other markets, are also influential. We conclude that consumers' confidence in their own estimates is crucial in encouraging market activity.

Abstract: The New Regulatory Framework (NRF) for electronic communications was intended to usher in an era of harmonised regulation across the European Union leading to better choice, price and quality for European consumers. The European Commission has voiced its frustration at the fragmented nature of the implementation of the NRF. In this paper I examine whether the NRF has indeed been introduced in a fragmented manner and whether that fragmentation affects consumers, taking broadband penetration, which is regarded as desirable both socially and economically, as the measure of consumer outcome. I find that a causal relationship exists between public policy, prices of unbundled local loops, market concentration and adoption of broadband. Using a Lagged Dependent Variable model, I find that decreasing concentration in the market structure of broadband access technologies at retail level has a strong effect on the take-up of broadband, with the effect taking time to be fully realised. To enhance consumer adoption of broadband, therefore, policy makers in the EU should seek to improve the opportunity for broadband competition.

Abstract: After the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991, Slovenia became an independent state and entered into the transition period from a planned to a market economy. Slovenia's relative prosperity has been a key factor in the country's approach to reform, which has differed substantially from other Central and Eastern European countries. It has followed a gradualist approach to change, frequently postponing many key structural reforms (World Bank, 2006). After it had successfully completed the transition process, Slovenia became a new EU member state on 1 May 2004. Its political and economic system, legislation and institutional setting fully correspond to those in the EU. Today Slovenia is considered to be one of the most successful (ex-) transition countries from Central East and South East Europe. On 1 January 2007 Slovenia was the first among the new EU member states to join the EMU and introduce the euro as its official currency. The process of liberalisation of the Slovenian electricity market to a large extent resembles what other EU countries were witnessing. To comply with the EU legislation, namely the Electricity Directives (96/92/EC) and (2003/54/EC), Slovenia had to adopt the Energy Act (1999) and the amended Energy Act (2004). The Slovenian electricity market has been partially opened since 2001. From 1 July 2007, when households became eligible customers, the electricity market has fully opened.

Abstract: According to the Agreement on Stabilisation and Integration to European Union, Serbia is obliged to implement reforms in the power sector and its power policy must be in accordance with the European Union power policy. Power sector reforms in Serbia have been started, and certain results were achieved. But, the electric power infrastructure became technologically obsolete, and for its reconstruction significant investments and the active participation of the state are necessary. Operative efficiency is at very low level. Also, Serbia has not yet decided whether the Serbian Electric Power Industry will be privatised, and if it is privatised which model will be applied and when.

Abstract: Romania is a net exporter of electricity to the SE Europe region. Its performance of this role will increase in importance with a) the completion of another nuclear generator and b) improvement in capacity for international transmission. Romania has committed itself to an electricity restructuring plan that includes vertical separation, but plans remain uncertain regarding the horizontal restructuring of generation. Among the more important issues yet to be decided are a) how hydro capacity will be allocated – it has more than ¼ of capacity and enjoys low costs – and b) how many thermal generation enterprises will be created, and with what assets. With more than ½ of the thermal capacity accounted for by CHP plants and with a winter demand peak for the foreseeable future, there is a real danger of inflexibility and a lack of competitiveness in a liberalised wholesale electricity market.

Abstract: According to the recently announced decision of the Regulatory Agency for the Energy Sector, starting from 30 June 2007, Montenegrin households will pay and increased electricity price. The price of electricity for households with meters that have both off-peak and on-peak tariffs will be 6.28c€/kWh, while for those with only one tariff, the price of electricity will be 8.62c€/kWh. Such prices do not include value added tax which is an additional 17%, or 7.35c€/kWh and 10.1c€/kWh, respectively. Though other countries in the region do have block tariffs in place, the Montenegrin regulator decided not to go with such a solution since the intention is to reduce and finally dismiss any kind of cross-subsidies between different consumer groups. In addition, a block tariff is qualified as complicated for calculations. This significant price rise will impose a heavy burden on the poor households and it may adversely affect the environment. However, even though electricity tariffs are increased and it is expected will increase more, the Government of Montenegro did not come up with a proper safety net infrastructure for poor people; rather, ad hoc measures are taken. In an ex ante investigation of the welfare impact of this price increase on households in Montenegro, we show that the anticipated price increase will result in a very significant increase in households' energy expenditures. Higher electricity prices could also significantly increase the proportion of households using fuelwood for space heating. The Government of Montenegro needs to combine the pricing reforms with a carefully evaluated set of measures that will mitigate the effect of these reforms on the poor and the environment. A simulation of alternative policy measures shows that non-linear electricity pricing schemes may be a successful way of protecting the poor due to the high level of correlation between electricity consumption and income level in Montenegro. Alternatively, the Government of Montenegro could consider reforming the current social assistance scheme to broaden the base of qualifying households and improve the program's targeting of the poor, or it might evaluate the feasibility of innovative financing schemes with the participation of the private sector, the electric utility company, and an emphasis on improving energy efficiency in the residential sector. The analysis has been completed prior to the decision of the Regulatory Agency, but assumed price increase is a good approximation. In addition, the paper briefly introduces the current situation in the energy sector in Montenegro.

Abstract: The paper provides an overview of the electricity market reform in Greece which started in 2001 and is still developing slowly. This is related to the persisting dominance of the incumbent company and the specificities of the electricity sector of Greece, which is heavily dependent on indigenous lignite-firing generation, while being located in the periphery of the EU internal electricity and gas markets. Competition through enhancing electricity trade in the region is limited today, as the establishment of an internal market in South East Europe also progresses slowly. Development of competition through gas-firing generation by new entrants has been the priority adopted by State and Regulator's policies. However, the gas supply market in Greece and in the region still lacks behind.

Title: Bulgarian Electricity Market Restructuring
Author-Name: Peter Ganev

Abstract: The electric power system of the Republic of Bulgaria is part of the united system of mainland Europe (UCTE) composed of the electric power systems of 23 countries as well as parts of Denmark and Ukraine. Their annual electricity consumption reached 2,530 TWh at 2.5% average annual demand growth in the period 2003–2006 (following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to UCTE). Bulgaria and Romania are the largest electricity producers among the South East European countries. Bulgaria produced 45 billion kilowatt hours (Bkwh) of electricity in 2005. Bulgaria's nuclear facility, Kozloduy NPP, has allowed the country to become one of the major energy exporters in Europe, with the Bulgarian national electric company, Natsionalna Elektricheska Kompania EAD (NEK), exporting 7.5 billion kilowatts (Bkw) of electricity in 2005. Kozlodoy produced more than 40% of Bulgaria's electricity in 2005. Reactors No. 1 and No. 2 were decommissioned in December 2002, and Bulgaria's melectricity export potential shrank after it shut down reactors No.3 and No.4 in the beginning of 2007 due to EU safety concerns. After the closure of those units, only reactors No.5 and No.6 remained operational, generating an electricity shortage for the country and forcing it to significantly reduce electricity exports. In April 2006, the Bulgarian economy and energy minister announced that the cost of direct losses to Bulgaria is estimated to reach over $2 billion with the closure of the two units (No. 3 and No. 4). Bulgaria received $688 million from the EU as compensation for the closures. In January 2005, Bulgaria officially announced plans to have its second nuclear plant, Belene, operational by 2011 to offset the loss of the two reactors at the Kozloduy facility. In November 2006 the preliminary agreement was signed with the Russian company Atomstroyexport for engineering, procurement, and commissioning of Belene Nuclear Power Plants, Units 1 and 2 – two 1,000MW light water reactors. Design and construction will be supervised by Parsons Europe Ltd, while Italian energy utility Enel plans to hold a majority stake in the 2,000MW nuclear power station. It is estimated to cost between $3-5 billion and will be built along the Danube. Bulgaria fully liberalised its electricity market in July 2007, adhering to EU standards. The Government had already privatised seven power distribution companies, selling them to the Czech Republic's CEZ, Germany's E.ON, and Austria'
s EVN in 2005 for a total of $827 million. In 2006, Bulgaria's Privatisation Agency (PA) signed a draft contract to sell the 1,260MW Varna power plant to Czech utility CEZ for $250 million, after Russian utility company UES withdrew its $689 million offer earlier in the year over regulatory and environmental issues. CEZ has also pledged to invest another $140 million in the power plant. Bulgaria has the lowest electricity prices (in absolute terms) in EU-27. Household electricity prices have risen 13.6% over the last three years and are about 49% below the European averages. Similarly, industrial user prices have risen by 12.5% over the last three years and remain about 39% lower than the European averages. Prices for industrial users are lower in absolute terms than for households.

Abstract: We examine the effect of current electricity market reform on residential consumers, using a sequence of hypothetical scenarios which are likely to be prompted by reform. These include raising tariffs to cost-reflective levels and introducing a standing charge to recover 10% of the revenue to mirror cost-reflective structures. For Albania and Bulgaria, where household expenditure surveys and electricity tariffs are available, we analyse the effects of each scenario according to expenditure decile and region. We compare these results to findings from a previous study of Turkey. The impact of reforms varies considerably, depending on how far current tariffs reflect the long run marginal costs of supply, but likely reform scenarios will adversely affect low income households more than others.

Abstract: The paper provides an overview of the generation of electricity in ten countries in South East Europe during 1995–2004. Using the latest available statistics the potential of the nascent integration of the electricity markets in South East Europe is explored. We conduct a cross-country analysis of electricity production based on different types of fuel used. The region has a low level of gasification combined with few nuclear power generation facilities, while some countries heavily rely on hydro electric generation. Differences in countries' resource endowment and the possibility of intertemporaral substitution between electricity generated from various fuels could stimulate a regional trade in electricity. Such trade could displace a proportion of the required investment in the construction of generation facilities, as an alternative to nationally independent energy policies. Finally, we consider the environmental impact of electricity generation, and identify some of the key trade-offs between different policy objectives.

Abstract: This paper discusses the evidence on electricity reform and relates it to the current situation of the South East Europe (SEE) electricity market. We begin by discussing the main elements of the European Union (EU) electricity reform model. Then we go on to discuss emerging good practice in the regulation of national electricity markets in the EU. This is important because it reflects the key role placed on independent regulation of the electricity sector in the EU reform model. Next, we evaluate the empirical evidence on the success of the EU reform model in particular before discussing the success of electricity reforms more generally. This leads on to a discussion of the particular context of SEE electricity reform and what specific issues this raises. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of more general institutional context of SEE electricity reform. The paper suggests that it will be a substantial, but worthwhile, challenge to create a workable supra-national electricity market in the region.

Abstract: The Energy Community Treaty, signed in Athens in 2005, creates a legal framework for an integrated energy market between the European Union and nine South East European partners – Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and the United Nations Mission on behalf of Kosovo. This paper examines the challenges posed by the application of the EU model of energy regulation and the acquis communautaire, and the ability of States to meet those challenges. Given the recent historical context of the 1990s Balkans conflict and subsequent reconstruction efforts, a number of external countries and bodies have intervened in the region with aid and technical assistance programmes. However, the incentive of eventual EU membership affords the EU in particular a certain bargaining power through pre-accession instruments, and the Energy Community framework allows it to act as gatekeeper. This regulatory alignment, encouraging co-operation on technical issues, is expected to create spill-over effects in other sectors of reform. The paper considers whether the EU energy model is appropriate in South East Europe at this stage. It suggests that regulatory reform alone may not be sufficient – the domestic institutional framework is a significant factor. Analysis using the World Bank's quality of governance indicators suggests that different groups of countries should approach reform differently according to institutional capacity, and a 'one size fits all' solution may not be appropriate. This may have implications for targeting technical assistance and capacity building measures.

Abstract: To date the experience of the incidence of private actions for damages in antitrust cases has differed markedly across jurisdictions. The procedural rules surrounding private litigation may account for some of these differences. This paper explores the effect of rules concerning contribution among multiple defendants who are joint and severally liable for cartel infringement. The no-contribution rule is shown to lead to higher levels of aggregate damages and more information revelation to the private plaintiff. However, the no-contribution rule also has the potential to neuter any public leniency programme, thereby possibly reducing the number of cartels detected.

Abstract: The rivalry between developers of open source and proprietary software encourages open source developers to court users and respond to their needs. If the open source developer wants to promote her own open source standard and solutions, she may choose liberal license terms such as those of the Berkeley Software Distribution as proprietary developers will then and it easier to adopt her standard in their products. If she wants to promote the use of open source software per se, she may use more restrictive license terms such as the General Public License to discourage proprietary appropriation of her effort. I show that open source software that comes late into a market will be less likely than more innovative open source software to be compatible with proprietary software, but is also more likely to be made more accessible to inexperienced users.

Abstract: Monopoly pricing is a textbook market failure that is taught in the first year of any economics course. The implied welfare loss (or 'exploitative abuse') justifies a whole range of competition policy towards cartels, mergers and regulated industries. Yet there is widespread hostility to prosecuting the same exploitative abuse in the textbook monopoly case (i.e. under Article 82EC)! This paper seeks to understand this paradox. I conclude that, while there are important problems with prosecuting Article 82 exploitation cases (because of problems relating to measurement, market dynamics, multi-sided markets and remedy issues), it is important to keep open the possibility of prosecution; for example, in the forthcoming Article 82 Guidelines.

Author-Workplace-Name: School of Economics, University of East Anglia Abstract: Behavioural and industrial economists have argued that, because of cognitive limitations, consumers are liable to make sub-optimal choices in complex decision problems. Firms can exploit these limitations by introducing spurious complexity into tariff structures, weakening price competition. This paper models a countervailing force. Consumers' choice problems are simplified if competing firms follow common conventions about tariff structures. Because such a 'common standard' promotes price competition, a firm's use of it signals that its products offer value for money. If consumers recognize this effect, there can be a stable equilibrium in which firms use common standards and set competitive prices.

Abstract: The modernisation of EC antitrust rules timed to coincide with the 2004 enlargement of the European Union is widely recognised as an historic and revolutionary reform. According to the dominant view that has emerged in both law and political science, the change is to be explained in terms of the interest and ability of the European Commission to engineer a reform that, behind the guise of decentralisation to national authorities, has in practice extended its power and influence over the control of anti-competitive agreements. Drawing on original research, this paper contests the conventional wisdom and the image of the Commission as an imperialistic actor that underlines it. It argues that such a view dramatically overstates the Commission's power and that a more sophisticated explanation is required. First, the Commission was motivated more by changes in the thinking within an epistemic community of competition practitioners and lawyers than by an impulse to expand its authority. Second, contrary to the monolithic conception of the Commission on which the dominant view depends, the Commission was internally differentiated and the development of its reform proposals the product of internal negotiation and conflict, rather than the expression of an inner drive to expansionism. Third, scrutiny reveals the Commission to be a constrained organisation, rather than a body able to re-write competition law autonomously.

Abstract: Courts have traditionally granted injunctive relief 'automatically' upon finding infringement of valid patents on the basis that it is the essence of the patent right to exclude others. But the U.S. Supreme Court signalled a change in 2006 when they vacated the Federal Court's order granting injunction against eBay for willfully infringing valid patents of MercExchange. The ruling comes at a time when the debate on what have pejoratively been called 'patent trolls' has taken centre stage. This paper examines the issues connected to patent trolls and analyses cases post-eBay to study the effect that eBay has had on patent infringement litigation. The analysis shows that the economic status of the patentee and the nature of the patent itself can adversely affect the exclusive rights granted by the patent. This is because non-competing patentees and a patent which covers only a small component of the overall product are less likely to obtain an injunctive relief. Denial of injunctive relief results in judicially-instituted compulsory licensing of patents which dramatically scales down the bargaining power of the patentee during licensing fee negotiations. Wrongly being adjudged a 'troll' can have dramatic effects on the incentive for investment and innovation. Consequently, the paper argues that acceptance of the concept of patent 'troll' is likely to result in more harm to innovation that otherwise.

Abstract: In this paper, a dominant supplier and competitive fringe supply goods to a common buyer who has private information about the state of demand. We give conditions under which market-share contracts are proﬁtable, and we show that, in some cases, the full-information outcome can be obtained (unlike in standard screening models, where the agent earns an information rent in the high state and demand is distorted in the low state). Our results also inform the antitrust debate on bundling, ﬁdelity rebates and all-units discounts. We provide a new motive for a dominant ﬁrm to bundle its own product with a competitively supplied product (with ambiguous consequences for welfare), and we show that market-share contracts, which are a subset of ﬁdelity rebates, are more proﬁtable than all-units discounts.

Abstract: To prevent possible abuse of market power, an antitrust agency can force merging ﬁrms to divest some of their assets. The divested assets can be sold via auction either to existing competitors or to a new entrant. Divesture of assets extends the range of parameters when a merger satisﬁes a consumer surplus standard and should be approved. If the agency takes a more active stance toward the selection of a purchaser of the assets (e.g. to exclude an incumbent from the auction), then it could lead to a favourable outcome for consumers and merging ﬁrms.

Abstract: Electronic marketplaces (e-marketplaces) allow networks of buyers and sellers to conduct business online and to exchange information more efficiently using Internet technology. Despite the benefits that e-marketplaces potentially afford firms, concerns have been raised that these markets may damage competition. This study considers the antitrust or competition legislation related to e-marketplaces and examines the possible competition concerns they raise. Potentially anticompetitive features of e-marketplaces are examined and guidance for firm conduct when creating or participating in an e-marketplace is offered.

Abstract: This study examines the frequency and form of deposit account interest rate change. Specifically, the question of whether deposit interest rate change is synchronised with other banks or staggered at periodic intervals is addressed. Overall, evidence consistent with individual banks changing deposit interest rates in a staggered manner is recorded. Further, larger banks are seen to change interest rates in a more synchronised manner than smaller banks. Lastly, when banks offer multiple deposit accounts, these products' interest rates are generally changed simultaneously by individual banks. These findings extend the current understanding of deposit interest rate change, and indicate that UK deposit interest rate setting is relatively rigid.

Abstract: We consider a two-period model with two sellers and one buyer in which the efficient outcome calls for the buyer to purchase one unit from each seller in each period. We show that when the buyer's valuations between periods are linked by switching costs and at least one seller is financially constrained, there are plausible conditions under which exclusion arises as the unique equilibrium outcome (the buyer buys both units from the same seller). The exclusionary equilibria are supported by price-quantity offers in which the excluding seller offers its second unit at a price that is below its marginal cost of production. In some cases, the price of this second unit is negative. Our findings contribute to the literatures on exclusive dealing, bundling, and loyalty rebates/payments.

Abstract: The paper reports on results from a public survey on attitudes to collusion and cartel enforcement in Britain. Respondents demonstrate an understanding that price-fixing is harmful and should be punished. While there is strong support for high corporate fines and naming and shaming, only 1 in 10 Britons think individuals responsible should be imprisoned. Weak perceptions of the severity of price-fixing are confirmed by only 6 in 10 people considering such practices to be dishonest. Sex and age strongly influence attitudes. Education and newspaper readership have less of an effect, indicating poor information dissemination. Only 20% would report their employer's involvement in price-fixing without guarantees of anonymity and/or a reward; 14% would not report at all for fear of consequences. Public opinion is divided as to whether leniency programmes are justifiable. Respondents consider public enforcement to be more important than compensating parties injured by cartels.

We define a new measure of subjective household experience and explore links between this measure and the official objective definition, using a unique data set and the Family Expenditure Survey. We identify the relation between the two measures; explore the characteristics of households in each group; and how each measure is related to other household factors.

Abstract: Despite intense price competition firms obfuscate product information when it is relatively costless to reveal, contrary to neoclassical predictions. This paper considers whether firms can profitably conceal (part of) their prices for a homogeneous product when consumers differ in their ability to form expectations of market prices. The model shows that the ability to conceal prices but still attract naïve consumers dampens competition and allows prices to be set above marginal cost. This suggests that the European Commission was correct to pass regulations that require airlines to set prices inclusive of taxes, fees and charges, because alternative policies of educating a proportion of naïve consumers to become sophisticated or assisting consumers to search the market more effectively could increase prices in some situations.

Key findings of the work include the general efficiency enhancing influence of UK bank mergers and the limited effect of merger on retail interest rates. Furthermore, different banking products appear to be influenced differently by mergers. It is proposed that future assessments of bank competition and mergers require an accommodation of different types of bank customer.

Abstract: This paper analyses the potential effect of electricity reform on different households, using a series of potential scenarios for price changes, and consumption information from the 2003 Turkish Household Expenditure Survey. Turkey is emerging as a regional energy market, hub, and transit country between Europe and Asia, and has been reforming her energy sector in line with EU Energy Acquis since 2001. Introducing a cost reflective tariff is an essential component of Turkish electricity reform. Yet, this tariff structure might create real hardship for, and thus strong opposition from, some households, which might not be compensated through the rather underdeveloped Turkish social security system. Perhaps to avoid the possible political costs of this before the general election of November 2007, the Turkish Government disregarded the sector regulator EMRA's insistence, and postponed pursuing such tariff for at least five years. Identifying these households, however, helps to anticipate opposition, and perhaps to mitigate it partially through compensation schemes. This might also facilitate Turkey's integration with the Energy Community of South East Europe created in 2005. To explore the likely effect of tariff changes on various groups of households we apply six scenarios. Firstly, we analyse the likely impact of EMRA's proposal of reflecting large regional variation in technical and non-technical losses. We also consider the effect of a potential efficiency saving from the proposed merger of distribution companies. Then, we explore the potential outcome of raising the currently low ratio of residential to industrial tariffs to OECD average. Furthermore, we study the effect of reducing the rather high level of taxes on households. Lastly, we examine the likely consequence of changing the present flat rate prices per kilowatt hour to a tariff which reflects more accurately the pattern of consumer-related and consumption-related costs.

Abstract: This paper estimates the implicit model, especially the roles of size asymmetries and ﬁrm numbers, used by the European Commission to identify mergers with coordinated eﬀects. This subset of cases oﬀers an opportunity to shed empirical light on the conditions where a Com-petition Authority believes tacit collusion is most likely to arise. We ﬁnd that, for the Commission, tacit collusion is a rare phenomenon, largely conﬁned to markets of two, more or less symmetric, players. This is consistent with recent experimental literature, but contrasts with the facts on 'hard-core' collusion in which ﬁrm numbers and asymmetries are often much larger.

Abstract: This paper suggests that the ability of consumers to choose accurately between alternative suppliers is substantially limited even in a relatively simple and transparent market. Across two independent datasets from the UK electricity market we find, on aggregate, that those consumers switching exclusively for price reasons appropriated between a quarter and a half of the maximum gains available. While such outcomes can be explained by high search costs, the observation that at least a fifth of the consumers actually reduced their surplus as a result of switching cannot. We consider and reject several alternative explanations to pure decision error.

Abstract: This paper investigates empirically whether owner motivations are consistent with neoclassical models of profit maximisation. Contrary to the neoclassical model, in some markets owners gain private benefits from supplying products with certain characteristics. To consider this issue, a full theoretical model that allows owners to consider not only profit, but also utility, in their choices of price, product quality, and the use of an owner-specific production method was developed. Information was gathered on owner motivations from the UK speciality food sector to test the propositions of the theoretical model. Evidence of systematic utility maximisation is found and utility maximising owners set higher profit maximising prices and produce a higher quality product. These findings have implications for the UK speciality food sector.

Abstract: This paper provides a first attempt to understand how outcomes are determined by the standard institutions of merger control. In particular, we focus on the internationally standard 2-phase investigation structure and remedy negotiations of the form practiced by the EC. We find that there are inherent biases in remedy outcomes, and identifiable circumstances where offers will be excessive and where they will be deficient. In particular, we find clear circumstances in which firms offer excessive remedies, which goes against a possible intuition that firms should expect to extract an information rent for possessing superior information about competition in the market.

Abstract: Information, it is said, is power, and the proliferation of web-based information systems (IS) has made the potential for empowerment by information available to an increasingly large user population. The empowerment of consumers through quality of service information is a key component of modern UK economic and competition policy in order to both resolve certain information asymmetries between traders and consumers and facilitate switching, i.e. the ability of consumers to switch suppliers of goods and services. Using a case study approach, this paper concentrates not on the intricacies, physical design or specific information content of the IS itself but on the regulatory approach taken by the UK telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, to provide it. It considers how the mechanisms set up to provide and audit appropriate, comparable and reliable information actually favour the interests of the traders rather than the consumers. The result is that those people at whom such information is undoubtedly aimed (consumers) and who need it to make rational choices in the market are actually disempowered, particularly those vulnerable groups who may have special information requirements. It concludes that if consumers are to be properly empowered by information in such systems, the regulator must do more to better protect the consumer interest and provide them with information they actually need and not the information that the traders are willing to provide.

Abstract: This paper explores and quantifies the link between marketing and rulings on competition or antitrust law made by UK competition or antitrust authorities. This examination is timely due to both the changing form and increasing severity of competition law in the UK and the strong associations identified between marketing and antitrust law in the US literature. Through a comprehensive examination of past UK competition rulings from 1950 to 2005, the frequency and content of the principal forms of uncompetitive behaviour during the last half century are recorded. A high proportion of competition law violations are associated with the marketing function. UK competition authorities have viewed specific marketing practices and, more generally, the direction, scope and scale of marketing activity to be causes for concern. We conclude that marketers need to develop a greater awareness of competition law and contribute more to the ongoing discussion as to the present and future form of competition policy.

Abstract: In this article we chart the development of competition and deregulation of the British retail energy markets, explaining the evolution of competitive constraints when consumers are introduced to supplier choice for the first time.  In the context of rising real energy prices for consumers, and continued market power on the part of incumbents, we address the question of whether the control of pricing practices through the ex post provisions of the general competition law is sufficient to protect consumers.  We also explore the issue of whether reliance solely on these provisions is desirable given the uncertainty which surrounds the application of the Chapter II prohibition (governing abuse of dominance), specifically in respect of price discrimination in final markets.  We conclude that the outcome of the liberalisation experiment in terms of delivering benefits for consumers is unclear.

Abstract: This paper discusses the role of State Attorneys General in the enforcement of the federal antitrust laws in the U.S.  It provides a substantial background on the doctrinal roots of the State Attorney General's power to enforce federal antitrust laws.  Then, it analyses the advantages of the state enforcement mechanism both in terms of providing redress to consumers and deterrence to undertakings.  Building upon this framework and the empirical data on state enforcement, the paper critically analyses the proposals of the Antitrust Modernization Commission on state enforcement.  It suggests that the State Attorneys General constitute a vital part of the federal antitrust scheme, and problems associated with their enforcement efforts are largely over-stated.  Even if there really is a danger of over-enforcement, the paper argues that the problem can be solved through less dramatic amendments.

Abstract: This paper questions whether discrimination between consumers by a dominant undertaking can and should constitute an abuse of a dominant position under Article 82EC.  By finding that it can, the paper challenges the traditional interpretation of the discrimination ban under that provision, namely that discrimination constitutes abuse only when directed against the intermediate customers of the dominant undertaking.  As such, the paper seeks to clarify the scope of Article 82EC as regards discrimination, and elaborate on whether discrimination between consumers should be abusive. This is done from both a law and an economics perspective, in order to put forward a proposal to ensure that competition law does not prohibit discrimination where economics finds it potentially welfare enhancing.

Abstract: This paper shows how separately itemised surcharges potentially facilitate collusion during a temporary cost if firms commit to their duration.  A duopoly model with price-matching punishments shows that if firms set higher prices they only receive punishment during the shock because they expect prices to fall in the future regardless of a deviation.  When it is likely that costs will fall in the future, the price-matching punishment is too small to increase prices, so firms maintain rigid prices.  When it is unlikely that costs will fall the punishment is harsh enough to sustain marginally higher supracompetitive prices.  However, if firms commit to surcharges for the shock's duration they are able to set even higher prices, because surcharges effectively commit firms to a price decrease and so threaten a harsher punishment after the cost shock has ended.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the Somerfield decision of the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT). In that decision, the CAT demonstrated a high degree of deference to the Competition Commission where the latter was scoping divestiture remedies in a merger case. This approach is consistent with the case law of the US and EC and, it is argued, is appropriate given the need for procedural expediency.

Abstract: This paper analyses the impact of the transition from price-cap regulation (deposit/loan rate control) to rate-of-return regulation (ROA, NPLs and/or BIS ratio) on banking industry structure. A simple theoretical model of banking competition suggests that the relative dominance of the two objective functions under different regulatory regimes affects the market structure. Imposing more stringent rate-of-return regulation, whilst relaxing price-cap regulation, reduces the equilibrium number of banks. The result from the theoretical model is also supported by empirical evidence from Korea, which has undergone substantial consolidation in recent years. The empirical analysis uses a unique data set of the entire commercial banking sector in Korea between 1976 and 2003, which covers both pre- and post- banking crisis periods.

Abstract: In applications as diverse as banking, supermarket and catalogue sales, it has been clearly identified that prices have a strong propensity to cluster around certain digits. This study forwards an explanation and empirical investigation of price clustering in retail markets, through an examination of how interest rates cluster in two UK financial services markets. It is proposed that price or interest rate clustering forms in retail markets as firms wish to maximise returns from customers who have difficulties in recalling and processing price information.  To compensate for limited recall, individuals use different behavioural strategies, such as rounding and truncating number information, which are recognised by firms when setting prices or interest rates. This theory is developed and tested using a dataset of retail interest rates from the UK which enables interest rate clustering to be viewed in both lending and investment markets, and at different levels of financial involvement.  It is found that interest rate clustering occurs in a manner consistent with firms maximising returns from customers who have less ability in recalling and processing number information. Further, the degree of interest rate clustering observed is exaggerated for investors of smaller monetary quantities, for firms which profit maximise and at higher market rates of interest.

Abstract: Turkish electricity reform is entering a new phase through the Turkish Government's proposal to create 21 new distribution companies, 18 of them through merger.  Two aspects of merger analysis are the operational cost savings and the potential production efficiency gains.  This paper concentrates on the second aspect and uses a recently developed methodology to assess the potential effect of these mergers and whether these mergers are efficiency enhancing.  This is performed by comparing the actual efficiency levels of observed distribution companies with the merger of proposed aggregated companies.  The model is calibrated on panel data from 1999 to 2003 which include measures of physical capital and labour inputs, as well as customer and energy related outputs.  The results indicate potential for considerable efficiency gains from the proposed mergers.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of dynamic indefinite horizon R&D races with uncertainty and multiple prizes. The theoretical predictions are highly sensitive: small parameter changes determine whether technological competition is sustained over time or converges into a market structure with an entrenched leadership and lower aggregate R&D research. The subjects' strategies are far less sensitive. In three out of four treatments (with the exception being a control treatment), the R&D races tend to converge to entrenched leadership. Investment is highest when rivals are close, and there is evidence of average over-investment.

Abstract: The past and current reluctance of firms and individuals to use private enforcement suggests that there are limited incentives for self-help. The key contribution of private enforcement to overall deterrence derives from cases which would not otherwise be brought, not simply because of resource constraints, but also because relevant information would not otherwise have come to light. In terms of revealing such private information, cases initiated and pursued by private litigants add much more to the equation than do cases merely following-on from decisions made by competition authorities. In this paper we use a simple model to highlight what features of the private enforcement system promote and hamper the use of these two different types of private enforcement. A key finding is that that to encourage new cases, it is essential that private enforcement is quicker than the time it takes to get a decision in a follow-on case.

Abstract: This paper develops a signalling model to look at some effects of the inclusion of an efficiency defence in merger regulation. By incorporating Type I and Type II errors into the antitrust agency's pay-off function approval probabilities are endogenized. The agency can choose to use a fuzzy approval rule (mixed strategies) after observing a double signal (produced evidence and the way it has been produced) as a tool to (partially) separate different merger types by changing approval probabilities and, consequently, firms' expected payoffs from a merger. The separation leads to a lower value of the expected mistake by the agency. If the agency can commit to certain policies, then a fuzzy approval rule is preferred under a wide range of parameters.

Abstract: This paper investigates competition between chain-stores and independents in the UK opticians' industry, using the relationship between the number of outlets present in a local market and the market size. Chain-stores are shown to have a significant effect on local market competition. In addition, the empirical approach is extended to allow inferences on the nature and extent of product differentiation. The results are broadly consistent with a model of vertical product differentiation in which chain-stores adopt national pricing strategies. The evidence suggests that the nature of competition between independent retailers depends on whether a chain-store is present.

Abstract: The 'two-thirds rule' stands as a caveat to the quantitative jurisdictional thresholds stipulated in the Merger Regulations. It prevents the attribution of a 'Community dimension' to large business mergers where two-thirds of the parties' respective turnovers are made in one and the same member state. It sees the relevant national authority and not the European Commission enjoy competence to assess the competitive effects of such a transaction. In the immediate aftermath of Gas Natural/Endesa - a case which the European Commission accepted only reluctantly did not possess a Community dimension - the Competition Commissioner mooted the legislative repeal of the two-thirds rule. The reception by member states of a proposal on these lines is unlikely to be uniformly generous. This note first reviews the origins and content of the two-thirds rule, before proceeding to consider the current momentum behind and prospects for successful reform. It suggests that a wider rapprochement between divergent perspectives on the best approach to achieving economic development both within and across the member states of the EC – and in particular on the problematic issue of support for 'national champions' – will likely be necessary before any revision can occur.

Abstract: Where fines are the only available sanction against cartels there is a trade-off between increased deterrence and the increased risk of insolvency. Higher fines are unacceptable to the European Commission because of the costs and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These concerns have led to the emergence of a 'financial constraints' discount which is applied with a lack of transparency and may be strongly influenced by the EC treaty objectives of protecting employment and social justice. Such bankruptcy discounts encourage infringing firms to paint as gloomy a picture of their financial situation as possible to reduce their cost of collusion. They also provoke cartel members into raising prices further, safe in the knowledge that they will never incur fines high enough to threaten their financial viability. The existence in the US of a parallel 'loose' bankruptcy discount allows international infringing firms to cite sanctions previously incurred in the US as grounds for 'financial constraints' in Europe. The effect is lower fines to the detriment of EC deterrence and international enforcement.

Abstract: This paper analyses the impact of various types of deregulation on banking industry structure. The empirical result is supported by evidence from Japan and Korea, which have undergone a substantial consolidation following a series of deregulation. The analysis is applied to a unique data set of the entire commercial banking sector in Japan and Korea, which covers both pre- and post- banking crisis periods. The paper also draws attention to the role of banking sector in the East Asian industrialisation, which influenced its idiosyncratic banking regulation and the evolution of the banking structure using the structure-performance relationship.

Abstract: This paper analyses the behaviour of banks' customers when a new technology (internet banking) is introduced. The determinants of consumer adoption of internet banking are characterised using survey data from Korea in both static and dynamic framework. There is evidence that adoption of internet banking is influenced by sex, age, marital status, degree of exposure to internet banking, and the characteristics of the banks. A duration analysis shows no evidence of first mover advantage (order effects) in internet banking whilst the largest bank (rank effects) in commercial banking remains dominant in internet banking. The results imply that the internet banking adoption is dominated by social norm effects.

Abstract: The structure of conglomerates embedded in the strong vertical ownership network in East Asia was believed to be a driving force for the economic success but was also blamed for the recent financial crisis in Asia given the fallacy – too big to collapse. This paper introduces a notion of collective relationship banking (CRB) as a mechanism for monitoring private information and investigates the likelihood of such banking relationship when the borrowing firms have heterogeneous vertical ownership structure using a Korean firm level panel dataset. Policy concerns are then addressed since the post-crisis corporate restructuring may create a more concentrated banking relationship with a few dominant banks.

Abstract: Although the 1996 'Notice on the non-imposition or reduction of fines in cartel cases' has been criticised by academics as lacking clarity and certainty, it has been described in European Commission literature as an 'indisputable success' and as having played an 'instrumental role' in uncovering and punishing secret cartels. This paper makes an empirical assessment of horizontal cartel cases in the EC opened as a result of leniency applications under the 1996 notice. Nearly three quarters of the cartels apparently uncovered by this notice were subject to equivalent prior or simultaneous investigations in the U.S. In addition, most of the cartels that were revealed operated in the Chemical industry, were all connected to each other by virtue of the same firms' involvement in more than one cartel, and all failed or ceased to operate before being revealed to the Commission by a cartel member. These two findings would suggest that the 1996 leniency notice was only of limited success in inducing firms to reveal cartels and that most applications for immunity were as a natural consequence of cartels failing and firms looking once more to their own interests rather than those of the cartel. The leniency notice largely succeeded in uncovering failed cartels, not active ones.

Abstract: Within a one-shot, duopoly game, we show that firms cannot use false instore price comparisons to deter rational consumers from further beneficial price search in an effort to create market power. However, by introducing a consumer protection authority that monitors price comparisons, we formalise Nelson's (1974) conjecture by showing that 'middle-order' monitoring can actually facilitate the deception of fully rational consumers, to deter them from otherwise optimal search. Despite this effect, we show that no increase in monitoring can ever harm consumers thanks to a second, larger effect that improves consumer information and increases the intensity of price competition.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the Most-Favoured-Customer (MFC) clause identified in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) Report on Foreign Package Holidays behaves not like an MFC but rather as if it was a variant of a so far unstudied price matching guarantee. This provides a clearer explanation than that by the MMC of why the guarantee is not in the public interest. The subsequent Court of Appeal decision focused attention on whether or not the MFC came with matching funding. It correctly identified that this made a difference, but was wrong in claiming that with matching funding the MFC would benefit consumers. As a result, the latest Foreign Package Holidays Order still does not provide the necessary prohibition of MFC clauses.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how a profitable, downstream merger can lower the merged entity's input price while raising that of its rivals, leading to an adverse effect on final consumers. This novel 'waterbed' result is surprising and very different to the unilateral and co-ordinated effects usually considered in the analysis of horizontal mergers. When demand is linear, all mergers involving a powerful buyer harm overall welfare even though the merger leads to marginal cost reductions that substantially increase output by the merged entity.

Abstract: Cointegration analysis has been used to assist the testing for price delineation in antitrust and merger cases as a way of deepening econometric evidence. This paper examines the impact of the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act (1999) instigated in 2001. By addressing the industry as a cointegrated system containing retail, wholesale and farm prices, short run and long run relationships were examined. Cointegration analysis between farm, wholesale and retail sectors suggests that the wholesale sector plays an important role within system. The econometric estimations find that long run wholesale pricing is weakly exogenous whilst farm and retail prices follow the same trend. This finding suggests that it may be as a result of market inefficiency and calls for further analysis of the role that the wholesale sector plays within the industry.

Abstract: This policy paper offers a synthesis of research on privatisation and its impacts on the utilities sector in different countries. It identifies issues to be considered by policy makers concerned with economic reform, including the implications of sequencing privatisation together with competition, regulation and industry restructuring; the role and importance of an independent regulatory agency; and the impact of introducing competition into utility markets. In addition to assessing reform through the more conventional method of examining productivity gains, it considers the distribution of the broader benefits from reform among key stakeholders –government, investors and consumers.

Abstract: Delineation of the relevant market forms a pivotal part of most antitrust cases. The standard approach is sequential. First the product market is delineated, then the geographical market is defined. Demand and supply substitution in both the product dimension and the geographical dimension will normally be stronger than substitution in either dimension. By ignoring this one might decide first to define products narrowly and then to define the geographical extent narrowly ignoring the possibility of a diagonal substitution. These reflections are important in the empirical delineation of product and geographical markets. Using a unique data set for prices of Norwegian and Scottish salmon, we propose a methodology for simultaneous market delineation and we demonstrate that compared to a sequential approach conclusions will be reversed.

Abstract: This paper analyses the strategic use of fixed costs to deter entry or monopolize a market in a standard Cournot framework. First of all a general case shows how the presence of fixed costs can affect the possible equilibria to the Cournot game. It is shown that the presence of a firm with a first-mover advantage can have important implications if fixed costs are raised. In addition the forward induction process becomes important in determining plausible equilibria. The use of firstly regulation and secondly 'nuisance' law-suits are considered as strategies to increase fixed costs.

Title: Price Deception, Market Power and Consumer Policy
Author-Name: Chris M. Wilson

Abstract:  This paper presents a model in which a firm attempts to gain market power by pricing above the competitive market price and simply trying to persuade illinformed consumers not to search for other lower priced firms. Fictitious price comparisons, or false sale signs could be used in this way to deceptively and profitably deter consumer search. A simplified model shows how this mechanism could exist when combined with moderately enforced consumer regulatory policy.
