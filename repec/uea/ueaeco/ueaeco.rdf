Abstract: We examine colonial-era primary education as a determinant of modern-day attainment and gender disparities in education. We construct a novel dataset from the French Protectorate in Morocco, combining archival data on colonial school locations in 1931 and 1954 with the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data in arbitrary grids. We analyse the influence of colonial schools on the probability of attaining primary and secondary education in 2004. Overall, schools dedicated to Moroccans in 1931 exhibit a persistent positive impact on education outcomes, but only in the absence of nearby schools reserved for Europeans. Stark gender gaps in access during the Protectorate were narrowed in places with schools for Jewish Moroccans. These had a positive impact on girls’ contemporary levels of education, but a negative impact on the enrolment for boys following the dismantling of Jewish communities after 1948. DHS measures of preferences for female education point to a social norms transmission mechanism between Jewish and Muslim Moroccan communities.

Abstract: In conventional proxy VAR analysis, the shocks of interest are identified by external instruments. This is typically accomplished by considering the covariance of the instruments and the reduced-form residuals. Alternatively, the instruments may be internalized by augmenting the VAR process by the instruments or proxies. These alternative identification methods are compared and it is shown that the resulting shocks obtained with the alternative approaches differ in general. Conditions are provided under which their impulse responses are nevertheless identical. If the conditions are satisfied, identification of the shocks is ensured without further assumptions. Empirical examples illustrate the results and the virtue of using the identification conditions derived in this study.

Abstract: A central assumption for identifying structural shocks in vector autoregressive (VAR) models via heteroskedasticity is the time-invariance of the impact effects of the shocks. It is shown how that assumption can be tested when long-run restrictions are available for identifying structural shocks. The importance of performing such tests is illustrated by investigating the impact of fundamental shocks on stock prices in the U.S.. It is found that fundamental shocks post-1986 have become more important than in the pre-1986 period.

Abstract: The shocks in structural vector autoregressive (VAR) analysis are typically assumed to be instantaneously uncorrelated. This condition may easily be violated in proxy VAR models if more than one shock is identified by a proxy variable. Correlated shocks may be obtained even if the proxies are uncorrelated and satisfy the usual relevance and exogeneity conditions individually. Examples from the recent proxy VAR literature are presented. It is shown that assuming uncorrelated proxies that satisfy the usual relevance and exogeneity conditions individually actually over-identifies the shocks of interest and a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) algorithm is proposed that ensures orthogonal shocks and provides efficient estimators of the structural parameters. It generalizes an earlier GMM proposal that works only if at least K-1 shocks are identified by proxies in a VAR with K variables.

Abstract: In this paper, we identify a novel form of multiplicative market microstructure noise, referred to as fragmentation noise, which arises when the same asset is traded across multiple venues. We demonstrate that conventional estimators, such as realized variance and other well-established noise-robust methods, yield inconsistent estimates in the presence of fragmentation noise. To address this estimation issue, we propose a two-step estimator. In the first step, we model prices in different trading venues using a vector error correction model, leveraging its common trend representation to estimate the efficient price of the asset. In the second step, we compute the realized variance estimator using the estimates of the efficient price. We derive the asymptotic distribution of our proposed two-step estimator and conduct comprehensive simulation experiments. An application to the constituents of the DJIA reveals that our two-step estimator outperforms or performs on par with the univariate estimators under consideration.

Abstract: The research on measuring technological innovation quality has evolved with our understanding of the origin of novelty. Patents have been widely used in such studies because they are a form of copyright-protected outcome of inventions deemed to be valuable. The quality of technological innovation can be measured in multiple dimensions. In this paper, we make a methodological contribution to the literature on ex-ante technological novelty and propose two new indices based on a network approach: the Inverse Recombination Intensity Index (IRII) to capture the extent to which an invention is the outcome of a novel combination of pre-existing technological components; and the New Technology Ratio (NTR) to measure the share of new knowledge elements in the invention. Through an in-depth empirical study of patents filed in the Pharmaceuticals and Computer Technology sectors, we show that our proposed indices are correlated with some of the conventional patent quality indicators and go beyond that to reveal previously unnoticed features of the inventions process, of which some are sector-specific. Moreover, through our regression analysis, we demonstrate that IRII and NTR are important predictors of a patents potential impact on future inventions, which confirms the ex-ante nature of our indices. In the regression analysis we also include sector-country-specific R&D input variables as controls to test the robustness of our results. Our analysis suggests that the distinct characteristics of each sector affect how the quality of innovation is related to the ex-ante measures of technological novelty. We argue, therefore, that future analysis of the link between ex-ante novelty and ex-post quality of innovation needs to take into consideration the recombinant content of the invention and account for sectoral characteristics.

Abstract: We investigate information processing in the stochastic process driving stocks volatility (volatility discovery). We apply fractionally cointegration techniques to decompose the estimates of the market specific integrated variances into an estimate of the common integrated variance of the efficient price and a transitory component. The market weights on the common integrated variance of the efficient price are the volatility discovery measures. We relate the volatility discovery measure to the price discovery framework and formally show their roles on the identification of the inte-grated variance of the efficient price. We establish the limiting distribution of the volatility discovery measures by resorting to both long span and infill asymptotics. The empirical application is in line with our theoretical results, as it reveals that trading venues incorporate new information into the stochastic volatility process in an individual manner and that the volatility discovery analysis identifies a distinct information process than that based on the price discovery analysis.

Abstract: Proxy variables have gained widespread prominence as indispensable tools for identifying structural VAR models. Analogous to instrumental variables, proxies need to be exogenous, i.e. uncorrelated with all non-target shocks. Assessing the exogeneity of proxies has traditionally relied on economic arguments rather than statistical tests. We argue that the economic rational underlying the construction of commonly used proxy variables aligns with a stronger form of exogeneity. Specifically, proxies are typically constructed as variables not containing any information on the expected value of non-target shocks. We show conditions under which this enhanced concept of proxy exogeneity is testable without additional identifying assumptions.

Abstract: The governance of natural resource wealth is a key factor in promoting strong institutions and economic development in resource-rich countries. In this paper, we explore how individuals engagement in local natural resource revenue (NRR) management can be enhanced and encouraged. We focus on Indonesia, which is a large gold and petroleum producer, among other natural resources, with local challenges such as underdevelopment of resource-rich areas and corruption. We run a randomized survey experiment among 807 local community members in an oil-rich district using videos with three information treatments that give citizens salient and easily understandable information on local NRR and additional motivation to use this information to engage in NRR management. Our outcomes include survey questions on stated behavior and citizen rights perception regarding NRR management, and two incentive-compatible measures. We find that providing easily understandable information increases respondents sense of the right to personally influence how NRR are used and the propensity to donate to an anti-corruption NGO. Our positive example treatment was able to increase respondents sense of their right to benefit from NRR and their right to influence NRR management, while our negative example treatment had no impact on our outcomes. We also explore intervening mechanisms and heterogeneous effects. Providing the population of resource-rich areas with easily understood information on NRR management that is relevant to the local context offers an encouraging avenue for combating NRR-related mismanagement and corruption.

Abstract: Although integrity education and awareness is touted as an important solution to combat corruption, there is little evidence on its effectiveness. To fill this gap, we conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment where law students in Ukraine are randomly assigned to an innovative and interactive integrity training programme to enhance students awareness and behaviour around ethical issues. We collect data on attitudes towards corruption and actual corrupt behaviour through a series of surveys and a novel experimental game, in which both the integrity-trained students and those who did not get assigned to integrity training play the role of middlemen in a bribe exchange between firms and public officials. We show that integrity training had a significant impact on attitudes towards corruption but only significantly reduced corrupt behaviour in the game when the students knew they were playing alongside other integrity-trained students.

Abstract: Weather variation plays a primary role in commodity price formation. In most contexts, the amount of rainfall is usually taken by farmers as an indicator of crop success or failure. However, the literature is still vague in defining when in the pre-harvest period weather information is more critical for price formation. In this sense, we investigate the impact of dryness on commodity price formation during the pre-harvest period and across phenological stages in the context of a major corn producing country. We build a database containing variables such as price and the number of days with no precipitation between January 2005 and December 2019. We use a panel data regression of corn spot prices on the number of days without rain, and its squares. We find a significant and nonlinear relationship between the number of dry days in a week and local corn price variations. Overall, prices start rising after 4 days with no precipitation. Disentangling this impact into phenological stages, we find that dryness events tend to impact prices during the vegetative and flowering stages but have no effect during the grain filling stage. We also find that abnormal precipitation events tend to increase corn prices, as they contribute to depressing farmers expectations on future corn availability by harvest time. However, this result is led by water scarcity events, while, on the contrary, water overabundance events negatively affect prices.

Abstract: Studies of the crude oil market based on structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models typically assume a time-invariant model and transmission of shocks or they consider a time-varying model and shock transmission. We assume a heteroskedastic reduced form VAR model with time invariant slope coefficients and test for time varying impulse responses in a model for the global crude oil market that includes key macroeconomic variables. We find evidence for changes in the transmission of shocks to oil price expectations during the last decades which can be attributed to heteroskedasticity.

Abstract: This paper aims to derive a consistent test of Granger causality at a given expectile. We also propose a sup Wald test for jointly testing Granger causality at all expectiles that has the correct asymptotic size and power properties. Expectiles have the advantage of capturing similar information as quantiles, but they also have the merit of being much more straightforward to use than quantiles, since they are defined as least squares analogue of quantiles. Studying Granger causality in expectiles is practically simpler and allows us to examine the causality at all levels of the conditional distribution. Moreover, testing Granger causality at all expectiles provides a su¢ cient condition for testing Granger causality in distribution. A Monte Carlo simulation study reveals that our tests have good finite-sample size and power properties for a variety of data-generating processes and di¤erent sample sizes. Finally, we provide two empirical applications to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed tests.

Abstract: This paper aims to use copulas to derive alternative estimators of Health Concentration Curve, hereafter CH, and Gini coefficient for health distribution. We motivate the importance of expressing health inequality measures in terms of copula, which we in turn use to build copula-based semi and non-parametric estimators of the above measures. Thereafter, we study the asymptotic properties of these estimators. In particular, we establish their consistency and asymptotic normality. We provide expressions for their variances, which can be used to construct confidence intervals and build tests for health concentration curve and Gini health coe¢ cient. A Monte-Carlo simulation exercise shows that the semiparametric estimator outperforms the smoothed nonparametric estimator, and that the latter does better than the empirical estimator in terms of Mean Squared Error. We also run an extensive empirical study where we apply our CH and Gini health coe¢ cient estimators to show that the inequalities across U.S. states socioeconomic variables like income/poverty and race/ethnicity explain the observed inequalities in the U.S. COVID-19s infections and deaths.

Abstract: Principals are the gatekeepers of education and can influence student achievement through management practises. However in many countries discretionary staff appointments, corruption and inefficiency undermine the quality of management and education. Meritocratic selection in public service has been advocated as a tool to elevate management quality. We analyse the short-term impact of the 2016 introduction of merit-based selection for Romanian state school principals on students school-leaving test scores. Employing a staggered difference-in-difference strategy, we study the impact of competitively selected principals (compared to those appointed), and the impact of new principals (compared to principals who retain their position). The average treatment effect is small and insignificant immediately after the policy, with some evidence that new principals begin to improve outcomes two years on, particularly in schools with average historical performance. Since principals have limited management autonomy, this improvement is likely due to strategic selection of students into sitting the exam, but additional survey data also suggests the policy selects principals that are more motivated for the job. The evidence points to benefits and limitations of merit based recruitment policies in education.

Abstract: How can citizens be motivated to demand accountability in the management of public revenues? We carry out a video survey experiment among 2300 Ghanaian respondents to study the impact of information provision and role models on attitudes and demand for accountability in the management of petroleum revenues. We find that providing information significantly increases knowledge about current revenue management, satisfaction with the way revenues are handled and spent, and the intention to demand more accountability. Role models have an additional effect: they increase the sense that an individual can influence how petroleum revenues are used, and the intention to contact media and to vote differently to ensure better accountability. However, a follow-up survey two years later shows that these impacts do not last. The experiment demonstrates that providing relevant information affects attitudes and intended behavior in the short term and that role models can give valuable encouragement for behavioral change.

Abstract: Despite the extensive empirical evidence of a positive impact of economic freedom on economic growth, the influence of economic freedom and its components on a firms level of cash, leverage and investment remains an unexplored issue in microeconomics and corporate finance research. In this study, we contribute towards filling this gap by examining whether Credit Market Freedom - an important component of the Economic Freedom Index – influences corporate decisions. In particular, we study whether and to what extent Credit Market Freedom affects a firms target level of investment, cash holdings, and leverage. We observe the behavior of a large and heterogeneous sample of North American non-financial firms over the period 2000-2019. Our empirical results suggest that higher Credit Market Freedom is associated with a healthier corporate capital structure, higher financial flexibility, and a friendlier investment environment.

Abstract: We propose the Knowledge Origin Re-Combination Index (KORCI) to measure the ex-ante technological novelty of inventions at the sectoral level. The index is developed through the intertemporal comparison of a sequence of networks, which represents the complex 10 connections between the technological components listed in subsequent cohorts of patent applications in the sector. Using patent data from three sectors, we are the first to document the cyclical nature of the evolution of ex-ante technological novelty. Further investigation into the correlation between KORCI and patent application growth rates suggests that this relation, however, is sector-specific. This suggests that the relation between the degree of ex-ante 15 technological novelty and invention activities depends on the specific drivers of innovation in the sector – whether it is process-based or application-based.

Abstract: Do some search engines produce better search results because their algorithm is better, or because they have access to more data from past searches? In the latter case, mandatory data sharing, a policy that is currently discussed, could trigger innovation and would benefit all users of search engines. We document that the algorithm of a small search engine can produce non-personalized results that are of similar quality than Googles, if it has enough data, and that overall differences in the quality of search results are explained by searches for less popular search terms. This is confirmed by results from an experiment, in which we keep the algorithm of the search engine fixed and vary the amount of data it uses as an input.

Abstract: Understanding the best ways to incentive recycling and improve the efficiency of waste practices is a key environmental, social and economic management problem that needs addressing. We search for solutions to this issue by implementing a field experiment with two incentive mechanisms (a piece-rate and a lottery-based systems) in three different locations; a residential, a workplace and a student environment. We model our experimental data with the Bass Model, which to the best of our knowledge has never been employed to analyse experimental data and to gather a deeper understanding of the diffusion process among individuals adopting the recycling service. Our results indicate a high degree of heterogeneity across our trial locations. Incentivising recycling can stimulate action by those on lower incomes through opportunities for income generation. By contrast, those in workplace environments engage with or without incentives, but the latter does seem to boost activity. Our study contributes to the literature by providing evidence on how to best increase public involvement through recycling and provides important insights for policy making to address this worldwide relevant issue.

Abstract: We examine gender biases in the attribution of leaders’ outcomes to their choices versus luck. Leaders make unobservable investment choices that affect the payoffs of group members. High investment is costly to the leader but increases the probability of a good outcome (high payoff). We observe gender biases in the attribution of bad outcomes. Bad outcomes of male (female) leaders are attributed more to their decisions (luck). These biases are driven by male evaluators and evaluators who are prosocial. We find no gender differences in the attribution of good outcomes. We conjecture that benevolent sexism may be driving our results.

Abstract: If socio-economic status (SES) and genetic variants are both assets in marriage markets, then the two will become associated in spouse pairs, and will be passed on together to future generations. This process provides a new explanation for the surprising persistence of inequality across generations, and for the genes-SES gradient: the genetic differences we observe between high- and low-income people. The gradient includes differences related to human capital and to physical and mental health, so understanding its origins is important for understanding inequality in general, and health inequalities in particular. We model social-genetic assortative mating (SGAM) and test for its existence in a large genetically-informed survey. We compare spouses of individuals with different birth order, which is known to affect socio-economic status and which is exogenous to own genetic endowments among siblings. Spouses of earlier-born individuals have genetic variants that predict higher educational attainment. We provide evidence that this effect is mediated by individuals’ own educational attainment and income. Thus, environmental shocks to socio-economic status are reflected in the DNA of subsequent generations. Our work uncovers a new channel by which economic institutions can affect long-run inequality; suggests that genes-SES gradients may be historically widespread; and shows that genetic variation is endogenous to social institutions.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer sharing has become increasingly popular in recent years. Many digital platforms exist that allow individuals to use others’ belongings part-time. These platforms explicitly mention their green credentials, as the environmental benefits of such sharing initiatives are often taken for granted. However, several recent empirical studies show evidence of the contrary. For the first time in the literature, we provide a theoretical framework to analyze the economic and environmental implications of peer-to-peer sharing. We present a stylized model where a monopolist supplies a product that is suitable for rent on a sharing platform. Counterintuitively, we find that the existence of such a platform is typically beneficial for the monopolist, especially if it can strategically choose the price and lifespan of the product to affect the use price in the sharing market. Such a scenario is not at all beneficial for consumers, especially for those who rent the good rather than buy it. Moreover, the existence of the sharing platform induces higher use and (under some likely conditions) larger production levels and shorter lifespans of the products. The combination of these three aspects contributes to a worse environmental impact with sharing, which provides a theoretical rationale for the aforementioned empirical studies.

Abstract: We propose a test for time-varying impulse responses in heteroskedastic structural vector autoregressions that can be used when the shocks are identified by external proxy variables as a group. The test can be used even if the shocks are not identified individually. The asymptotic analysis is supported by small sample simulations which show good properties of the test. An investigation of the impact of productivity shocks in a small macroeconomic model for the U.S. illustrates the importance of the issue for empirical work.

Abstract: Existing theories of the effects of the printing press treat it as speeding up the transmission of technical knowledge. This cannot explain why a large proportion of both manuscripts and early printed books was religious. We argue that books transmit prudential and moral rules as well as technical information. These culturally transmitted rules provide a foundation for economic rationality, and solve problems of trust in large markets. In Europe, cheaper book production stimulated not only scientific progress, but also new forms of religion, which used book reading to inculcate rules appropriate to the emerging modern economy. We model the effect of the printing press on economic growth. Initially religious works dominate, but as the stock of technical knowledge grows, the proportion of technical works increases.

Abstract: We investigate whether gender distorts performance evaluation in environments where outcomes are determined by unobservable choices and luck. Evaluators form beliefs about leaders choices and make discretionary payment decisions. We find that while discretionary payments made to male leaders are determined by both outcomes and evaluators beliefs, those made to female leaders are determined by outcomes only. We label this new source of gender bias as the gender belief-outcome gap. Our findings imply that good outcomes are necessary for women to get bonuses, but men can receive bonuses for bad outcomes as long as evaluators hold them in high regard.

Abstract: We study the effects of anticipated discrimination in prosocial domains against sexual minorities using a sharing (dictator) game in an online experiment. Recipients are given the opportunity to signal their sexual identity. Decision-makers, upon observing these signals, decide how much of their endowment to share with their matched recipients. We find that female, but not male, recipients are less likely to signal their sexual minority status when they are aware of the potential payoff implications of their decisions. Investigating the treatment of sexual minorities by decision-makers, we find that decision-makers are similarly generous based on the recipient's chosen signal of their sexual minority status. However, the intersection of decision-makers' political affiliations and the perceptions of these signals matter: Republican heterosexual decision-makers are less generous to others whom they perceive to be sexual minorities, while their Democratic counterparts are slightly more generous. This cannot be explained by religious affiliation or perceptions about the recipient's political leaning, but it is consistent with the direction of their implicit bias against homosexuals.

Abstract: We extend the Smooth Transition Vector Autoregressive model to allow for identification via a combination of external instruments and sign restrictions, while estimating rather than calibrating the parameters ruling the nonlinearity of the model. We hence oer an alternative to using the recursive identification with selected calibrated parameters, which is the main approach currently available. We use the model to study how the effects of monetary policy shocks change over the business cycle. We show that financial variables, inflation and output respond to a monetary shock more in a recession than in an expansion, in line with the predictions from the financial accelerator literature.

Abstract: Does financial intermediation affect structural change? We investigate both theoretically and empirically whether financial development accelerates structural change during the post-industrialization phase where employment, value-added and expenditure shares change towards services and away from manufacturing. We build a dynamic general equilibrium model where firms and households face different types of intermediation costs, and structural change can be driven by mutually independent technology differences { exogenous productivity gaps or asymmetric factor elasticities { as well as by learning-by-doing. Besides suggesting a stronger impact of financial development when productivity is endogenous and services are labor-intensive, all the model specifications robustly predict that exogenous reductions in intermediation costs { e.g., deregulation shocks { accelerate the pace and extent of structural change. We test this prediction empirically by examining the effects of state by- state bank branching deregulation in the United States in the 1970-1990s period. Using a range of estimation techniques including synthetic control methods { pooled, augmented, and with staggered treatment { we show that bank branching deregulation accelerated the structural change that was already underway, i.e., services account for a greater share of output and employment than they would have in the absence of deregulation.

Abstract: Pollution is one of the world's primary causes of premature death, but macroeconomic analysis largely neglects the existence of such negative externality. We build a tractable multi-sector growth model where innovations raise productivity, a polluting primary sector exploits natural resources, emissions increase mortality, and fertility is endogenous. The response of the mortality rate to changes in population size is generally ambiguous and often non-monotonic, and reflects a precise equilibrium relationship that combines emission intensity, dilution e¤ects and labor reallocation e¤ects caused by technology. Deadly spillovers a¤ect welfare through multiple channels - including market-size e¤ects - and create additional steady states, including mortality traps that undermine development in less populated resource-rich countries even for low emission elasticities. Emission taxes yield double dividends in terms of income and population capacity, whereas subsidies to primary production reduce potential population and may trigger population implosion especially if combined with new discoveries of polluting primary resources.

Abstract: Different local projection (LP) estimators for structural impulse responses of proxy vector autoregressions are reviewed and compared algebraically and with respect to their small sample suitability for inference. Conditions for numerical equivalence and similarities of some estimators are provided. A new LP type estimator is also proposed which is very easy to compute. Two generalized least squares (GLS) projection estimators are found to be more accurate than the other LP estimators in small samples. In particular, a lag-augmented GLS estimator tends to be superior to its competitors and to perform as well as a standard VAR estimator for sufficiently large samples.

Abstract: Decision makers in positions of power often make unobserved choices under risk and uncertainty. In many cases, they face a trade-off between maximizing their own payoff and those of other individuals. What inferences are made in such instances about their choices when only outcomes are observable? We report fndings from two experiments that investigate whether outcomes are attributed to luck or choices. We show that attribution biases exist in the evaluation of good outcomes. On average, good outcomes of decision makers are attributed more to luck as compared to bad outcomes. This asymmetry implies that decision makers get too little credit for their successes. Interestingly, the biases are exhibited by those individuals who make or would make the less prosocial choice for the group as decision makers, suggesting that a consensus effect may be shaping both the belief formation and updating processes.

Abstract: Natural selection has been documented in contemporary humans, but little is known about the mechanisms behind it. We test for natural selection through the association between 33 polygenic scores and fertility, across two generations, using data from UK Biobank (N = 409,629 British subjects with European ancestry). Consistently over time, polygenic scores associated with lower (higher) earnings, education and health are selected for (against). Selection effects are concentrated among lower SES groups, younger parents, people with more lifetime sexual partners, and people not living with a partner. The direction of natural selection is reversed among older parents (22+), or after controlling for age at first live birth. These patterns are in line with economic theories of fertility, in which higher earnings may either increase or decrease fertility via income and substitution effects in the labour market. Studying natural selection can help us understand the genetic architecture of health outcomes: we find evidence in modern day Great Britain for multiple natural selection pressures that vary between subgroups in the direction and strength of their effects, that are strongly related to the socio-economic system, and that may contribute to health inequalities across income groups.

Abstract: Gambling preferences are analysed using survey data from the wider population. Respondents were confronted with a hypothetical lottery question, in which they were asked to imagine having just won a large prize, and asked how much of this prize they would be willing to invest in a further gamble. We observe the majority of respondents avoiding the gamble altogether. We demonstrate that such behaviour cannot easily be explained by standard models of choice under risk, since it implies implausible degrees of risk aversion. We propose that the observed behaviour can instead be explained in terms of gambling aversion. Since the decision variable takes the form of the number of \units" of the prize that the respondent wishes to invest in the gamble, and since the decision is observed twice for some respondents, we adopt the panel version of the Zero-In ated Poisson model as an econometric framework. We assume that individual characteristics aect both stages of the decision-making process. We are particularly interested in the effect of gender, and we find that males have a signficantly higher probability of participating in the gamble, and are also (conditional on gambling) prepared to gamble significantly larger amounts.

Abstract: We propose a new bootstrap for inference for impulse responses in structural vector autoregressive models identied with an external proxy variable. Simulations show that the new bootstrap provides confidence intervals for impulse responses which often have more precise coverage than and similar length as the competing moving-block bootstrap intervals. An empirical example shows how the new bootstrap can be applied in the context of identifying monetary policy shocks.

Abstract: We examine how local governments’ political alignment with central government affects subnational fiscal outcomes. In theory, alignment could be rewarded with more intergovernmental transfers, or swing voters in unaligned constituencies could be targeted instead. We analyze data from Ghana, which has a complex decentralized system: District Chief Executives (DCEs) are centrally-appointed local administrators loyal to the ruling party, while district MPs may belong to another party. A formula for transfer distribution aims to limit the influence of party politics. Using a new dataset for 1994-2014 and a regression discontinuity design, we find that despite this system, districts with aligned MP and DCE receive more transfers, have higher district expenditure, and more internally generated funds. Results are strongest for a subsample of constant districts over the period, suggesting that municipal fragmentation has weakened political alignment effects. We also show strong electoral cycle effects, and find a crowd-in effect for Ghanaian districts.

Abstract: While real US GDP per capita has increased around 80% since 1980, median incomes have remained roughly constant. However, as this paper documents, this stagnation masks an important decline. Male median real incomes have been lower than that of their forebears, at every age, for the last 30 years. We show that this is true across the life cycle and across the wage distribution. Moreover, younger generations have also had to wait longer to reach peak earnings. Further analysis shows that this decline is particularly concentrated on high school graduates. The same pattern is found for female high school graduates yet, African American and Hispanic American women are an important exception. Variance decompositions suggest that these intergenerational differences are quantitatively important. While reductions in hours worked cannot explain the decline, substantial decreases in the labour share are consistent with decreasing incomes in the face of productivity growth. Calculations suggest that hedonic improvements in the quality of goods and services would have to have been equivalent to 30% of younger cohorts’ lifetime consumption for their consumption levels to match those of their predecessors

Abstract: Feeding backyard wildlife has impure public good characteristics { it can satisfy specific human motivations whilst also improving bird populations. We document a surge in human interest in connecting with wild birds during lockdowns in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Using an event-study design, we find large increases in bird engagement that begin very soon after lockdown. Responses are stronger for areas with more important bird habitat. Investments appear sustained, at the rst beginning with bird feeders, then seed and baths. We estimate that lockdown feeding may increase spring populations of birds that visit feeders by 1-5% and avoided the death of 30,000-161,000  edgling birds, potentially more than offsetting declines in bird populations from habitat loss and pesticide use for 2020. Bird engagement in response to lockdown likely enhanced resilience for both humans and birds alike.

Abstract: In this paper I study the extent to which the nexus between concentration and interbank linkages affects financial stability, using data for a sample of 19,689 banks in 69 countries from 1995 to 2014. I find that high levels of interbank exposures decrease the probability of observing a systemic banking crisis, when the banking system is either highly concentrated or fragmented. The relationship between concentration and stability is found to be non-monotonic, as predicted by Martinez-Miera & Repullo (2010), although not U-shaped.

Abstract: We consider Cournot competition in general equilibrium. Decisions in firms are taken by majority voting. Naturally, interests of voters–shareholders or stakeholders–depend on their endowments and portfolios. We introduce two notions of local Cournot-Walras equilibria to overcome difficulties arising from non-concavity of profit functions and multiplicity of equilibrium prices. We show existence of local Cournot-Walras equilibria, and characterize distributions of voting weights for which equilibrium allocations are Pareto optimal. We discuss the performance of various governances and highlight the importance of financial markets in regulating large firms.

Abstract: The use of Multiple Price Lists to elicit individuals' risk preferences is widespread. To model data collected through this method, we introduce the Multivariate Random Preference (MRP) estimator, specifically designed for the \switching" variant of such lists. This is a new estimation approach that enables us to exploit all available information derived from subjects' switch points in the lists. Monte Carlo simulations show that our estimator is consistent and has good small-sample properties. The estimator is derived for a two-parameter model in a risky context.

Author-Workplace-Name: University of East Anglia
Abstract: Structural VAR models require two ingredients: (i) Informational sufficiency, and (ii) a valid identification strategy. These conditions are unlikely to be met by small-scale recursively identified VAR models. I propose a Bayesian Proxy Factor-Augmented VAR (BP-FAVAR) to combine a large information set with an identification scheme based on an external instrument. In an application to monetary policy shocks I find that augmenting a standard small-scale Proxy VAR by factors from a large set of financial variables changes the model dynamics and delivers price responses which are more in line with economic theory. A second application shows that an exogenous increase in uncertainty affects disaggregated investment series more negatively than consumption series.

Abstract: We formulate a continuous-time price discovery model and investigate how the standard price discovery measures vary with respect to the sampling interval. We ﬁnd that the component share measure is invariant to the sampling interval, and hence, discrete-sampled prices suﬃce to identify the continuous-time component share. In contrast, information share estimates are not comparable across diﬀerent sampling intervals because the contemporaneous correlation between markets increases in magnitude as the sampling interval grows. We show how to back out the continuous-time information share from discrete-sampled prices under cer-tain assumptions on the contemporaneous correlation. We assess our continuous-time model by comparing the estimates of the (continuous-time) component and information shares at diﬀerent sampling intervals for 30 stocks in the US. We ﬁnd that both price discovery measures are typ-ically stable across the diﬀerent sampling intervals, suggesting that our continuous-time price discovery model ﬁts the data very well.

Abstract: Does institutional change in the petroleum sector lead to more oil and gas exploration and discoveries? Foreign ownership and investment in the sector has traditionally been unrestricted. We document that this is no longer the case; foreign-domestic partnerships are the norm today. Tracking changes in legislation between 1867 and 2008 for a panel of countries, we show that switching to foreign ownership results in more drilling and more discoveries of petroleum than domestic ownership. Switching to partnership yields even more drilling, but yields fewer discoveries. Discoveries, and the intensity and quality of exploration drilling, are endogenous to industry-specific institutional change.

Abstract: We study psychological games of cheap talk communication involving players who have misaligned material interests and reciprocity preferences. We find that full and efficient information transmission is often impossible if reciprocity concerns are too high. Furthermore, higher material preference misalignment may facilitate the achievement of full information transmission. A key driver of our results is that truth-telling is not per se a kind action by the sender. We contrast discrete and continuous environments, alternative conceptions of reciprocity preferences and consider one-sided reciprocity models.

Abstract: Using tools from behavioural economics and psychology to establish non-financial ways to incentivise people to reduce domestic energy usage has become a popular and ever-expanding area of research. This study builds upon the existing literature by providing subjects with energy performance information at group-level in a controlled field experiment setting. Results suggest that the provision of relative information does stimulate energy-conserving behaviour, with this being most pronounced among those who held pre-trial preferences for sustainable living. These variations in usage and responsiveness indicate that the attitudes and structure of social groups are key drivers in determining the extent to which behavioural change is achievable. This in turn has relevance for energy policy, and implies that whilst both regulators and firms could improve consumer welfare and competition within the industry by issuing relative information on performance, the role of group cohesion and affiliation could heavily determine the magnitude of these benefits.

Abstract: This report outlines and reviews the findings of a collaborative project between researchers at The University of East Anglia (UEA) and Brandon Country Park. The former were commissioned to undertake two surveys to elicit the opinions of current users and stakeholders regarding their perceptions of the park, with particular emphasis on how this improves their mental, physical and social well-being. Information was then used to identify how the facility might be improved. 200 surveys were conducted through July 2016, asking questions which referred to park usage, attitudes and socio-demographic status. These responses were combined with a qualitative focus group, and using these mixed-methods field experiment techniques provided an in-depth examination of user perspectives on how to best manage this woodland amenity. The overall results pinpoint some key interactions between the key mental and physical benefits of such a facility, and yet the trade-offs that these human sources of welfare may create for wider biodiversity conservation.

Abstract: Improving the efficiency with which people consume domestic energy has become a show-piece of how behavioural psychology can be applied to the field of environmental economics. This study builds upon the literature by providing subjects with energy performance information at group-level in a controlled field experiment setting. Its novelty is that it seeks to test the persistence of energy-saving habits, whether extrinsic incentives accentuate or crowd-out a motivation to save energy, and how heterogeneity in environmental attitudes impact upon action. Results suggest that providing relative information does stimulate energy-conserving behaviour, with this being most effective among those who held pre-trial preferences for sustainable living. However, the treatment variations indicate that subjects regularly fail to maintain ‘good habits’ once an intervention stops. Furthermore, we find evidence to imply that rewarding groups in this competitive environment may create perverse long-run effects. This has an important relevance for energy policy: whilst providing relative information could improve both consumer welfare and energy demand forecasting, the timescale, frequency and mechanism by which this is undertaken requires careful scrutiny and planning if these potential benefits are to be maximised and undesirable side effects prevented.

Abstract: How does guilt affect participation in providing public goods? We characterise and analyse completely mixed symmetric equilibria (CMSE) in participation games where players are guilt averse. We find that relative to material preferences, guilt aversion can: facilitate the existence of CMSE; increase or decrease participation; and imply that group size has a non-monotonic effect on participation. Using our equilibrium characterisation we also re-analyse experimental data on participation games and find a low, but positive, guilt sensitivity parameter.

To identify whether the redistribution option increases coordination, and why, we also run experiments with no redistribution and forced redistribution. Our results show that the redis- tribution option does indeed significantly increase coordination. Disentangling the reasons why, we find that behaviour is most consistent with distributive preferences and one-step of forward induction (rather than signalling or two-steps of forward induction).

Abstract: We study the main shocks driving current account fluctuations for the G6 economies. Our theoretical framework features a standard two-goods inter-temporal model, which is specifically designed to uncover the role of permanent and temporary output shocks and the relation between the real exchange rate and the current account. We build a SVAR model including the world real interest rate, net output, the real exchange rate, and the current account and identify four structural shocks. Our results suggest four main conclusions: i) there is substantial support for the two-good intertemporal model with time-varying interest rate, since both external supply and preference shocks account for an important proportion of current account fluctuations; ii) temporary domestic shocks account for a large proportion of current account fluctuations, but the excess response of the current account is less pronounced than in previous studies; iii) our results alleviate the previous puzzle in the literature that a shock that explains little about net output changes can explain a large proportion of current account changes; iv) the nature of the shock matters to shape the relationship between the current account and the real exchange rate, which explains why is it difficult to understand the role of the real exchange rate for current account fluctuations.

Title: Advanced economies and emerging markets: Dissecting the drivers of business cycle synchronization

Abstract: What are the divers of business cycle synchronization within and between advanced and emerging economies at the sector level? This question is addressed by analysing international co-movements of value added growth in a multi-sector dynamic factor model. The model contains a world factor, region factors, sector factors, country factors, and idiosyncratic components. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods for 9 disaggregated sectors in 5 developed economies (G5) and 19 emerging economies for the 1972-2009 period. The results suggest that, while there exists a common 'regional business cycle' in the G5, fluctuations in sectoral value added growth are dominated by country-specific factors in the emerging markets. Despite that, the international factor (the sum of world and sector factors) is more important than the region factor, suggesting that the emerging markets are more synchronized with the G5. A simple regression shows that (i) the world factor would be more important the larger the share of agriculture in output; (ii) in more open economies the sector factor is more important in explaining sectoral VA growth fluctuations; (iii) the region factors is more important the richer and the less volatile the economy. Finally, a comparison of the variance of sectoral value added growth accounted for by each factor from the pre- to the post-globalization period shows convergence of the business cycles within the G5 and EM, respectively. The changes in the contribution of the world, sector and region factor are due to changes in the importance of those factors within sectors. However, for the emerging markets, the fall in the importance of the country factors is dominated by changes in the structural composition of the economies. Therefore, the evolution of the structural composition in the emerging markets could be an important driver for more synchronised business cycles at the regional and international level.

Abstract: Wealth creation driven by R&D investment and wealth dilution caused by disconnected generations interact with households' fertility decisions, delivering a theory of sustained endogenous output growth with a constant endogenous population level in the long run. Unlike traditional theories, our model fully abstracts from Malthusian mechanisms and provides a demography-based view of the long run where the ratios of key macroeconomic variables - consumption, labor incomes and financial assets - are determined by demography and preferences, not by technology. Calibrating the model parameters on OECD data, we show that negative demographic shocks induced by barriers to immigration or increased reproduction costs may raise growth in the very long run, but reduce the welfare of a long sequence of generations by causing permanent reductions in the mass of firms and in labor income shares, as well as prolonged stagnation during the transition.

Abstract: Cycles of intergroup revenge appear in large scale conflicts. We experimentally test the hypothesis that humans practice group-based reciprocity: if someone harms or helps them, they harm or help other members of that person's group. Subjects played a trust game, then allocated money between other people. Senders whose partners returned more in the trust game gave more to that partner's group members. The effect was about half as large as the effect of direct reciprocity. Receivers' allocations to group members were not affected by their partners' play in the trust game, suggesting that group reciprocity was only triggered when the partner’s intentions were unequivocal.

Abstract: People's preferences about the fair distribution of resources vary within and between different populations, and this affects many economic and political outcomes. We argue that a source of these differences is the social transmission of fairness norms from peers during adolescence. We ran an experiment on transmission of fairness norms in a friendship network of 11-15 year olds. Observing others' choices affects young people's fairness norms, as expressed in both their own choices and the attitudes they express. Our results show how young people can adopt redistributive norms via the social influence of their peer group. We also examine how the strength of social influence varies with friendship status and network position.

Abstract: This paper applies three valuation methods to estimate demand for reliable piped-water services in Ghana. Our goal is to estimate the economic value of reliable piped-water supply, and use competing methods to provide validity checks for our estimates. We survey 1,648 urban households and find that the average amount that households are willing to pay per month is GHS 44.73 or US$14.27 (Hedonic Price Method), GHS 22.72 or US$7.25 (Travel Cost Method) and GHS 47.80 or US$15.25 (Contingent Valuation Method) respectively. These amounts are equivalent to 3%-8% of households' income. This study provides evidence of the economic viability of private sector involvement in the water sector in Ghana. Our estimates seek to inform both managers and policy makers in their decision-making on reliable piped-water supply.

Abstract: Institutions for co-financing agreements often exist to encourage public good investment. Can such frameworks deliver maximal investment when agents are motivated by reciprocity? We demonstrate that indeed they can, but not in the way one might expect. If maximal investment is impossible in the absence of the institution and public good returns are high, then an agreement signed by all parties cannot lead to full investment. However, if all parties reject the co-financing agreement, then an informal deal to invest can lead to full investment. Agreement institutions may thus do more than just facilitate the signing of formal agreements; they may play a critical role in igniting informal cooperation underpinned by reciprocity.

Abstract: Researchers have utilized the fact that many states have term limits (as opposed to being eligible for re-election) for governors to determine how changes in electoral incentives alter state regulatory agency behavior.  This paper asks whether these impacts spill over into private sector decision-making. Using data from gubernatorial elections in the U.S., we find strong evidence that power plants spend less in water pollution abatement if the governor of the state where the plant is located is a term-limited democrat. We show that this evidence is consistent with compliance cost minimization by power plants reacting to changes in the regulatory enforce- ment. Finally, we show that the decrease in spending has environmental impacts as it leads to increased pollution.

Abstract: How do central politicians in young democracies secure electoral support at grass-roots level? I show that alignment with local governments is instrumental in swaying national elections via electoral fraud. Using a regression discontinuity design with Romanian local elections and a president impeachment referendum in 2012, I find higher referendum turnouts in localities aligned with the government coalition - the impeachment initiators. A variety of electoral forensics tests uncover abnormal vote count distributions across polling stations, consistent with null ballot stuffing and possibly vote buying. The alignment effect is driven by rural localities, those with weaker opposition party presence, and higher vote buying incidence in past elections. This illicit transfer from local to national government may explain the reverse clientelistic grants found in the intergovernmental transfers literature.

Abstract: In many applications of coalition formation games, a key issue is that some desirable coalition structures are not elements of the core of these games. In these cases, it would be useful for an authority which aims to implement a certain outcome to know how far from the original game is the nearest game where the desirable outcome is part of the core. This question is at the center of this study. Focusing on hedonic games, we uncover previously unexplored links between such games and transferrable utility games, and develop a tailor-made so- lution concept for the transferrable utility game, the implementation core, to provide an answer to our question.

Abstract: This paper analyses the effects of migration on per capita collected tax revenues. The panel data used includes 25 European Union (EU) countries and covers the period 1996-2010. The research contributes to the debate linking migration and tax, and finds evidence that net migration is a significant factor explaining tax revenues. In the case of EU countries, net migration accelerates to some extent the rise in collected tax, and strongly impacts on the level of tax revenues available per capita.

Author-Workplace-Name: University of East Anglia
Abstract: This paper provides consistent information criteria for the selection of forecasting models which use a subset of both the idiosyncratic and common factor components of a big dataset. This hybrid model approach has been explored by recent empirical studies to relax the strictness of pure factor-augmented model approximations, but no formal model selection procedures have been developed.  The main difference to previous factor-augmented model selection procedures is that we must account for estimation error in the idiosyncratic component as well as the factors. Our first contribution shows that this combined estimation error vanishes at a slower rate than in the case of pure factor-augmented models in circumstances in which N is of larger order than sqrt(T), where N and T are the cross-section and time series dimensions respectively.  Under these circumstances we show that existing factor-augmented model selection criteria are inconsistent, and the standard BIC is inconsistent regardless of the relationship between N and T.  Our main contribution solves this issue by proposing new information criteria which account for the additional source of estimation error, whose properties are explored through a Monte Carlo simulation study.  We conclude with an empirical application to long-horizon exchange rate forecasting using a recently proposed model with country-specific idiosyncratic components from a panel of global exchange rates.

Abstract: We propose a nowcasting model for the Indian real GDP growth rate which uses the flow of relevant information to update predictions on a daily basis and can serve as a timely barometer to track the Indian development process. There are several challenges faced when nowcasting GDP in developing economies such as India. The first challenge is to proxy im- portant missing variables such as international trade in the service sector. Our novel solution augments a baseline model with series on US and Euro-area output which improves predictions, particularly during the 2008-2009 global crisis. The second challenge is the impact of sizeable revisions to the GDP data. We construct a new series for real-time Indian GDP using press releases from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), finding that data revisions have a non-trivial influence on our results. Therefore, caution should be taken when evaluating predictions using the preliminary GDP release.

Title: Forecast evaluation with factor-augmented models

Author-X-Name-Last: Fosten
Author-Workplace-Name: University of East Anglia
Abstract: This paper provides an extension of Diebold-Mariano-West (DMW) forecast accuracy tests to allow for factor-augmented models to be compared with non-nested benchmarks. The out-of- sample approach to forecast evaluation requires that both the factors and the forecasting model parameters are estimated in a rolling fashion, which poses several new challenges which we address in this paper. Firstly, we show the convergence rates of factors estimated in different rolling windows, and then give conditions under which the asymptotic distribution of the DMW test statistic is not affected by factor estimation error. Secondly, we draw attention to the issue of "sign-changing" across rolling windows of factor estimates and factor-augmented model coefficients, caused by the lack of sign identification when using Principal Components Analysis to estimate the factors. We show that arbitrary sign-changing does not affect the distribution of the DMW test statistic, but it does prohibit the construction of valid bootstrap critical values using existing procedures. We solve this problem by proposing a novel new normalization for rolling factor estimates, which has the effect of matching the sign of factors estimated in different rolling windows. We establish the first-order validity of a simple-to-implement block bootstrap procedure and illustrate its properties using Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to forecasting U.S. CPI inflation.

Abstract: Recent research suggests that prosocial organizations are likely to have more prosocial employees, and that this match plays a significant role in organization contracting practices and productivity -- for example, in government. Evidence suggests that selection plays a role: prosocial employees are more likely to join prosocial organizations. In this paper, we ask whether prosocial behavior increases with tenure in prosocial organizations. Using a unique sample of nearly 300 mid-career Indonesian public officials, we find that subjects with longer tenure in the public sector exhibit greater prosocial behavior.

Abstract: Data from a sample of around 32,000 customers taking out personal loans from a Korean bank, are analysed. The focus of analysis is a binary variable indicating default, defined as any sort of failure to meet the obligations of the loan during a time period up to a fixed reference date. Around 1.5% of the sample defaulted. The Generalized Additive Modelling (GAM) framework is used to investigate the combined effect of a number of factors on the likelihood of default. The GAM framework allows flexibility in the effects of continuously- distributed predictors. The B-spline smoothing approach is used for each of these effects. An extensive model-selection process is implemented. It is found that the statistical fit improves if some, but not all, of the predictors are modelled with the B-spline. The two variables found to have non-linear effects are amount borrowed and age of borrower. The predicted probability curve obtained for the former shows that borrowers least likely to default are those that have borrowed at the 85th percentile of the amount-borrowed distribution. The prediction curve for the latter shows that the default probability declines in a stepwise fashion with age, falling abruptly at certain ages, but appearing to level off for significant periods within the life-cycle.

Abstract: This paper provides an empirical assessment of the driving forces behind structural transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa, and to further access the role of structural reforms in accounting for cross-country differences in transformation. Evidence from this paper reveals that country specific fundamentals, institutions and policy reforms as well as governance and fiscal reforms are the key drivers of transformation in the region. A set of policy strategies is proposed to engender sustained transformation and development in the region.

Abstract: Panel data from the German SOEP is used to test for risk vulnerability (RV) in the wider population. Two different survey responses are analysed: the response to the question about willingness-to-take risk in general; and the chosen investment in a hypothetical lottery. A con- venient indicator of background risk is the VDAX index, an established measure of volatility in the German stock market. This is used as an explanatory variable in conjunction with HDAX, the stock market index, which proxies wealth. The impacts of these measures on risk attitude are identifiable by exploiting the time dimension of the panel, and matching survey months with corresponding observations from these time-varying factors. Both of the survey responses allow us to test for decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA); in one case we find strong evidence of DARA, while in the other, we do not. Both survey responses also allow us to test for RV, and in both cases we find strong evidence. In the case of the hypothetical lottery response we are also able to estimate a "coefficient of risk vulnerability" (CRV). This is defined as the absolute amount by which absolute risk aversion rises in response to a doubling of background risk. We estimate CRV to be between 1.03 and 1.27.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical link between the two most prominent ways of modelling individual and collective contests as proposed by Tullock (1980) and Nitzan (1991) respectively.  By introducing Nitzan's sharing rule as a way of modeling individual contests we obtain a contest success function nesting a standard Tullock contest and a fair lottery.  We first provide an equivalence result between the proposed contest and Tullock's contest for the two-player set-up.  We then employ this nested contest as a way of introducing noise in multi-player contests when in the Tullock contest a closed form solution for the equilibrium in pure strategies does not exist. We conclude by comparing the proposed contest with the existing ones in the literature.

Abstract: The large empirical conflict literature has established a strong negative link between economic variables and the onset of an armed civil conflict.  However, it has been hard to demonstrate a clear causality becasue of potential endogeneity issues. Using three new exogenous instruments for income per capita in IV estimations, we show that the negative effect of income per capita on the probability of conflict is consistently strong and larger than in conventional pooled OLS estimations.

Abstract: We reconsider whether a grand multi-winner contest elicits more equilibrium effort than a collection of sub-contests.  Fu and Lu (2009) employ a sequential winner-selection mechanism and find support for running a grand contest. We show that this result is completely reversed if a simultaneous winner-selection mechanism or a sequential loser-elimination mechanism is implemented.  We then discuss the optimal allocation of players and prizes among sub-contests, and the case in which there is restriction in the number of sub-contests.

Abstract: We examine why heterogeneous communities may fail to provide public goods. Current work characterizes sanctioning free-riders as an undersupplied public good. We argue that often free-riders can be punished by the coordinated action of a group.  This punishment can be profitable, and need not be undersupplied.  But the power to expropriate defectors can also be used to expropriate outgroups.  Heterogeneous societies may be inefficient because minorities, rather than free-riders, are expropriated. Even if this is not so, groups' different beliefs about the reasons for expropriation may make the threat of punishment less effective at preventing free-riding.  We illustrate our theory with evidence from California mining camps, contemporary India, and US schools.  In a public goods experiment using minimal groups and a profitable punishment institution, outgroups were more likely to be punished, and reacted differently to punishment than ingroup members.

Abstract: Bargaining and coalition building is a central part of modern politics. Typically, game-theoretic models cannot predict a unique equilibrium. One possibility is that coalitions are formed on the basis of social identity loyalty to a gender, ethnic or political in-group. We test the effect of gender, race and ideological distance on coalition formation in a majority-rule bargaining experiment.  Despite the absence of any incentives to do so, we find that ideological distance significantly affects offers made to potential coalition partners. As a result, coalitions tend to be ideologically coherent, even though there is no ideological policy output.  We conclude that social identity considerations can determine equilibria in coalition formation.

Title: Ways to measure honesty: A new experiment and two questionnaires

Abstract: I report on the validity of different measures of honest behaviour. Subjects from 15 countries took part in two web-based experiments: a coin flip with a reward for reporting "heads", and a quiz with the possibility of cheating. Participants also answered questions on moral attitudes, and on unethical real world behaviour.  Honesty in the two experiments was correlated, and correlated with self-reports of behaviour. Answers to the attitudes questions did not correlate with the experimental measures or self-reported behaviour.  The quiz experiment provides a useful way to measure individual honesty in an online setting.

Title: Honesty and beliefs about honesty in 15 countries

Abstract: The honesty of resident nationals of 15 countries was measured in two experiments: reporting a coin flip with a reward for "heads", and an online quiz with the possibility of cheating. There are large differences in honesty across countries. Average honesty correlates with per capita GDP: this relationship is driven mostly by GDP differences arising before 1950, rather than by GDP growth since 1950, suggesting that the growth-honesty relationship was more important in earlier periods than today. The experiment also elicited participants' beliefs about honesty in different countries. Beliefs were not correlated with reality. Instead they appear to be driven by cognitive biases, including self-projection.
